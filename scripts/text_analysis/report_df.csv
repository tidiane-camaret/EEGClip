0,"CLINICAL HISTORY: 25 year old right handed woman with epilepsy since age 16, admitted with recurrent tonic-clonic seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, Lamictal
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is described as very drowsy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The drowsy state includes generous beta and low-voltage theta.  Vertex waves appear, as do spindles.  Brief stimulation of the patient produces a brief alerting with theta but sustained wakefulness was not identified.  Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is drifting in and out of sleep and did not activate the record.
HR:    90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Excessive theta in a drowsy patient.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were seen.  The excessive drowsiness may be due to this patient's medications or sleep deprivation.  She has eye movements into sleep which is not a pathological finding and can be seen in normal as well as well as those with sleep disturbances and depression. Prior EEGs demonstrated parietal spikes.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. The patient is cooperative.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a dynamic pattern. There are brief sections of the record where the EEG is medium amplitude, reasonably well organized with a 6 hertz background. This is disrupted by bursts of rhythmic, frontally predominant delta. In addition, there is arrhythmic delta activity sometimes identified in the occipital scalp region. There are shifting asymmetries but some of the arrhythmic delta activity is higher amplitude on the left compared to the right. Within the bursts of delta, there are subtle, slow, frontal spike and slow wave complexes. The epileptiform activity is not as prominent as the frontal delta. Hyperventilation produces prominent bursts of delta. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Markedly abnormal background.
2. Frontal spike and slow wave activity.
3. Occipital delta.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are similar to previous studies. No clinical seizures  were identified.

REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep, stage I.  Activating procedures, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  The patient has a normal amount of frontal central beta.  Activating procedures produce no abnormal discharges.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness and stage I sleep.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen intermittently at F7/T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 mV.  At times this slowing is slightly arrhythmic and periodic.
SEIZURES:  None.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is noted to have a
previous craniotomy site.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness there is a 9 Hz posterior
dominant rhythm. Superimposed upon this there is an area of focal delta with
arrhythmic mixed theta delta seen in the right to mid to posterior temporal region and
right central parietal region. On rare occasions right temporal sharp waves are noted.
Photic stimulation elicits little in the way of a driving response. Drowsiness is
characterized by an accentuation of the focal slowing, as well as more of a distribution
of the focal slowing in the right posterior quadrant. Hyperventilation seems to
accentuate the focal slowing more in a central temporal or central parietal distribution.

HR: 72bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Right temporal and central temporal focal slowing.
2. Rare right temporal sharp waves.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: The focal slowing is much less prominent than it was
years ago. The sharp waves are in the region of his previous craniotomy. Overall, this
study is unchanged compared to prior.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 25-year-old man with a history of cognitive impairment and seizures.  He had an episode of shaking and falling that occurred several days ago.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Zonegran, Depakote, and triamterene/hydrochlorothiazide.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of polymorphic poorly formed 8.5 to 9 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  The anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient is present, but fragmented at times.  Additional diffuse polymorphic theta is captured.  During drowsiness diffuse bursts of slow theta and increase in the amount of central beta is observed.  Hyperventilation is performed with poor effort and results in no significant change in the background.  Stepped photic stimulation does not result in additional abnormalities.
FINDINGS:
Mild diffuse slowing and disorganization.
No stage 2 sleep.
No clear epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is a mildly abnormal awake and drowsy 21 minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing and disorganization.  This finding indicates etiologic nonspecific mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  No epileptiform discharges were captured, however, stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If a clinical indication for seizures persist, a repeat study with stage 2 sleep may be of benefit.

INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of well-formed and modulated 9 Hz moderate amplitude alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During drowsiness the posterior dominant rhythm attenuates and symmetrical vertex waves are observed.  Hyperventilation was performed and the results have no significant change in the background.  Stepped photic stimulation results in occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.  A single EKG lead demonstrates a normal cardiac rhythm.
FINDINGS:
No stages of sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy 22 minutes EEG.  When compared to the EEG from 04/25/2008, epileptiform discharges seen over the right posterior temporal region are not captured on this study.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not preclude the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  If clinical indication for seizures persist, a repeat study with stage 2 sleep may be of benefit.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat slow with excess theta and a poorly defined 9Hz alpha rhythm. Hyperventilation is performed early-on in the record, clearly accentuating rhythmic mixed theta delta from the right temporal region as well as left temporal sharp waves. Following hyperventilation, the sharp waves and the rhythmic slowing gradually abate and the patient becomes somewhat drowsy. Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the record.

27,"CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 30-year-old woman, with epilepsy, 27 weeks pregnant.  The patient was admitted with a change in mental status.  She had a seizure on the 9th lasting 45 seconds and then another event today, question encephalopathy, question postictal, question behavior.
MEDICATIONS:  Metoprolol, heparin, Keppra, Ativan.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient had been sedated, had a recent seizure and was quite somnolent.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The initial sections of the EEG demonstrate a low voltage slow pattern with slow delta.  With stimulation, a scant 8 Hz alpha rhythm was noted.  The technologist was able to awaken the patient for hyperventilation which seems to produce some rhythmic, sharply contoured slowing in the right hemisphere, particularly in the right mid to anterior temporal region.  As the patient becomes drowsy bursts of high amplitude frontal delta were noted.
Photic stimulation did not activate the record.  Heart rate 78 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Abnormal background with a low voltage slow pattern.
Excess theta.
Rhythmic right delta particularly in the right mid temporal region notable with hyperventilation.
FIRDA.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG demonstrates a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function which may be due to a postictal state or medications.  In addition, there are focal features with rhythmic, sharply contoured slowing in the right temporal region.  Based on these findings, EEG monitoring was requested.

CLINICAL HISTORY: 41 year old right handed woman with episodes lasting 10-15 minutes with eyes rolling back in head, head turning to the left, confusion, seizure versus nonepileptic seizure.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Phenytoin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation is completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins, the background EEG is somewhat abnormal. There is excess theta. There are bursts of slowing. Right frontal temporal sharp waves are noted. There is also some shifting slowing. As the patient becomes drowsy, the asymmetry is a bit more remarkable with focal slowing in the right anterior temporal region and higher amplitude right anterior temporal spike and slow wave complexes. Bursts of sharp waves are noted as the patient transitions into sleep, which are seen first on the right and then on the left. The patient starts to transition into stage sleep. Sharp waves at that point are seen with an unusual field of spread, F8, T4, and then frontal left or right, or with an asymmetry, but with some bilateral representation. Photic stimulation elicits a vigorous driving response.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Abundant epileptiform activity with more than 1 localization.
2. Right anterior temporal sharp waves.
3. Sharply contoured delta from the left mid temporal region.
4. Some bifrontal sharp activity.
CLINICAL This EEG supports a focal mechanism for epilepsy. The
background slowing and the focal slowing may be correlated with imaging.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a well-defined 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  In relaxed wakefulness, discernable from her eye movement artifact there is some very subtle rhythmic 3-4 Hz left temporal theta.  This is apparent in relaxed wakefulness.  Photic stimulation elicits bilateral scant driving.  Brief drowsiness is characterized by attenuation of the alpha rhythm with more of a theta background.  Other features of drowsiness include an increase in beta.
HR:    78 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
A scant amount of left temporal theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Over the years, most EEGs for this adult have been normal.  The last time well-defined sharp waves were seen was when the epilepsy was diagnosed.

MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with an additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness.  Activating procedures, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation, were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz only seen over the left hemisphere.  Over the right hemisphere there is attenuation of all frequencies, including beta frequency, which can only be seen over the left hemisphere.  The patient is only recorded during wakefulness.
Activating procedures produce no abnormal discharges.  However, during hyperventilation the patient does start complaining of left arm numbness and pain.  During this time and intermittently there appears to be a change in the EKG lead to what appears to be bigeminy for seconds intermittently.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal attenuation of the entire right hemisphere and disruption of the posterior dominant rhythm seen throughout the recording.
Mild excessive theta in wakefulness, along with bursts of FIRDA in wakefulness.
SEIZURES:  During the recording the patient complained of her left arm hurting, which is consistent with her typical events, but there is no EEG correlate during this event.  The patient did not loose consciousness.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Right hemisphere attenuation and disruption of the posterior dominant rhythm in that hemisphere.
Mild generalized slowing.
FIRDA.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cortical dysfunction in the right hemisphere, which is consistent with a known hemiatrophy seen on the right hemisphere for this patient.  In addition, there is evidence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  The episodes of left arm burning did not have any EEG correlate.  However, please note that up to 75% of simple partial seizures may not be captured during scalp EEG.  Lastly, the patient did have some EKG abnormalities seen throughout the recording.  Due to this the patient was recommended to be seen in the emergency room right after the EEG.  She was taken there for this.

performed. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness the background EEG includes an 11.5 Hz
posterior dominant rhythm with posterior slow waves of youth. In relaxed wakefulness there are brief bursts of frontally predominant 3 to 5 Hz spike in wave activity with bursts typically 1.8 seconds in duration. Most are under 2 seconds and none exceed 3 seconds in duration. Hyperventilation seems to accentuate these bursts. An attempt to test for responsiveness during stimulation is attempted but the bursts are so brief that it is not possible to complete the test before the burst is over. There are no deficits in recall identified during the bursts. On rare occasions as the patient becomes drowsy, some of the bursts are a bit more maximum in the right frontal region. Other features of drowsiness include an increase in beta. Photic stimulation elicits a small amount of bilateral driving, but the spike in wave activity is not accentuated by this.

HR: 66bpm.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Frontally predominant 3 to 5 Hz spike in wave activity.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is an awake through stage
II sleep. Photic stimulation is performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.8 Hz alpha rhythm with
a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta activity. The patient transitions rapidly
between wakefulness and stage II sleep with vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and
POSTS. On one occasion as she is transitioning in and out of stage II sleep, during
photic stimulation, it appears that there is new or alpha activity on the right, almost as
there are vertex waves and POSTS. Photic stimulation produces supraharmonic driving
responses which can be differentiated from the patient drifting in and out of sleep, and,
in fact, she has a harmonic that is unusual in that it sometimes to be 3 or 5 times the
frequency of flash stimuli.
HR: 60 bpm with occasional PVC's.
IMPRESSION: This EEG is within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The features described above are interesting and unusual
but not necessarily pathological in nature. A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis
of epilepsy. A review of this patient's history may be helpful because significant sleep
deprivation might account for some of the features described above.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes continuous
eye blink. There is 13 Hz activity noted in the occipital regions but it is not possible to assess for
an alpha rhythm, although it does look as if there is a 13 Hz alpha rhythm. There is generous
diffuse faster frequency beta activity and continuous eye blink. Hyperventilation produces an
increase in background slowing. photic stimulation does appear to elicit a driving response
more so on the left than on the right. There is a suggestion of rhythmic right frontal theta

56,"CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 45-year-old right handed male with a history of motor vehicle accident 12 years ago and subsequent seizures.  Most recent seizure was approximately 3 to 4 months ago.
MEDICATIONS:  Current medications include Trileptal, Coumadin and Synthroid.
RECORDING TIMES:  Recording start time is 9:13 a.m.
Recording end time is 9:36 a.m.
Recording length is 21 minutes.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the record opens, there is a symmetric 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm that is of medium amplitude and is reactive to eye opening.  There was a small amount of frontocentral beta activity that is symmetrically distributed over the frontocentral regions bilaterally.  Throughout the recording, there is intermittent focal slowing noted over the left hemisphere.  This is maximal in the frontotemporal and frontocentral regions.  This is characterized by brief epochs of 5 to 6 Hz theta activity and rare very brief epochs of 2 to 3 Hz low amplitude delta activity.  When this is seen, it does disrupt the integrity of the posterior dominant rhythm on the left.  In addition to the focal slowing, there are sharp transient waves identified over the left frontal region.  These are not frankly epileptiform but are suggestive potentially of actual sharp waves.  There are no electrographic seizures detected and there were no clinical events denoted by the patient.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and did not induce a significant photic driving response.  The heart rate was between 60 and 90 beats during the recording.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG capturing wakefulness through drowsiness due to the presence of focal slowing over the left frontotemporal and frontocentral regions.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The presence of focal slowing may suggest a structural brain lesion in the left hemisphere.  Sharp transient waves are not frankly epileptiform but may be suggestive of an epileptiform discharge over the left hemisphere.  Clinical correlation is suggested.

MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Topamax
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there was a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm.  This is a clearly focal EEG with focal slowing in the left hemisphere, maximum in the mid-to-posterior temporal region.  There are simple T5 and T3 sharp waves noted in the background.  There are occasional spikes which are left anterior temporal followed by a T2 more subtle spike.  Hyperventilation accentuates the focal slowing with more rhythmic theta-delta in the left frontotemporal region and attenuation of faster frequency activity.  Drowsiness is characterized by attenuation of the alpha rhythm.  The alpha drops our earlier on the left than the right.  Other features of drowsiness include a transition to more left mid-to-posterior temporal focal slowing and sharp waves. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving on the right.
HR:    84 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Left temporal focal slowing, often posterior temporal.
Sharp waves in the left temporal region including anterior temple or posterior temple, and sometimes with the field extending to T2.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In the initial sections of the record, the background EEG is somewhat disorganized but as the recording continues, the overall organization improves with an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm. Drowsiness is characterized by anterior side of the alpha rhythm with vertex waves noted in stage 1 sleep. Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the record. By the close of the record, there is a little bit of shifting slowing in the right or left frontal region. Hyperventilation produces an increase in theta.

HR: 72 bpm with an abnormal QRS complex.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Disorganization noted early on the record improving as time goes on.
2. Transient, shifting frontal slowing, again improving as time goes on.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  This is an awake and drowsy record.  The patient has a previous craniotomy on the left.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low-voltage, frontocentral beta.  A prominent breach rhythm is identified in the left frontocentral region.  Subtle, underlying focal slowing is noted.  There are also bursts of somewhat higher amplitude slowing noted in the left frontocentral region.  As the patient becomes somewhat drowsy, there is a bit of shifting slowing, some of which includes T3 and T5.  The underlying slowing may be subtle or may include a bit more arrhythmic delta, which may be frontal or occasionally mid to posterior temporal. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving. Hyperventilation accentuates the bursts of focal slowing from the left.  During hyperventilation, there is some head rocking or electrode artifact noted, a bit more on the left.
HR:    90 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slowing noted in the left hemisphere with 2 types of focal slowing, the first being underlying subtle slowing and the second being more well-defined arrhythmic delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A breach rhythm is an anticipated finding following craniotomy.  There is some sharply contoured activity on the left in the region of the breach, but there are no definitive sharp waves.  This EEG is similar to many previous EEGs dating to 2002, but of note, in more recent years left mid-temporal sharp waves have not been identified.

Digital video·EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The study comprised patient
wakefulness and drowsiness.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a well
organized alpha rhythm. Features of drowsiness demonstrate some temporal region
sharp waves in T4 in addition to focal slowing. The hyperventilation generates diffuse
slowing. In addition, other features of drowsiness are stage 2 sleep. The photic
stimulation generates some vertex waves.

78,"LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  23 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 55-year-old man with a history of aneurysmal surgery, left frontal stroke, hemiparesis, and seizures.  EEG is being performed to assess the patient's baseline.
MEDICATIONS:  Current medications include phenobarbital, Dilantin, Prozac, and others.
CONDITION OF RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10/20 system, with additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is continuous right to left interhemispheric asymmetry with faster waveforms over the left hemisphere.  Of note, the patient is asleep throughout most of the recording.  During brief wakefulness, the posterior dominant rhythm over the left consists of moderate amplitude 9-10 Hz alpha activity. PGR No comment can be made about reactivity.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient over the left hemisphere.  Additionally, continuous excess beta activity is captured over the left hemisphere.  The posterior dominant rhythm over the right hemisphere is not clearly visualized.  The background during maximal wakefulness over the right consists of a mixture of polymorphic alpha and theta activity.  Additional polymorphic delta activity with paucity of faster frequencies is observed during drowsiness and sleep over the right hemisphere, primarily over the right frontotemporal region.  Intermittent moderate to high amplitude sharp waves with aftergoing slow waves are captured over the right anterior temporal region.  Phase reversal occurs over F8/T4 electrodes.  Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation results in no additional abnormalities.
FINDINGS:
Continuous moderate right hemispheric slowing, most pronounced over the right frontotemporal region.
Excess beta activity observed over the left hemisphere.
Suspected breach artifact over the left hemisphere.
Intermittent sharp waves with aftergoing slow waves over the right anterior temporal region, with phase reversal over F8/T4 electrodes.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal, mostly asleep, very briefly awake EEG due to continuous focal right hemispheric slowing, that is most pronounced over the right frontotemporal region, and intermittent epileptiform discharges over the right anterior temporal region.  These findings indicate likely underlying focal cerebral dysfunction that carries increased epileptogenic potential.  Excess beta observed over the left hemisphere could be secondary to the medication effect such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates. Breach effect could be secondary to a skull defect. Breach effect over that region.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video long-term EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  No activating procedures were performed.  Continuous spike wave detection as well as seizure detection software was used during the EEG.  In addition, patient alarms as well as nurses' notes were also used during the EEG.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a mildly diffuse slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches a frequency of 8 Hz, which appears to be reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen in the left mid-temporal region at T3 at a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz and an amplitude of 20 to 50 microvolts seen occasionally.
In addition, focal sharp waves are seen infrequently at T3, mainly in sleep.
EVENTS:  At 1:24 in the morning, the patient had an event.  In the video it appears that the patient suddenly becomes agitated and wants to go home.  He stands up abruptly from the bed and starts attacking the nurses and appears to want to stand up and leave.  He stands up out of the bed and disappears from the video.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consisted of a well formed and modulated moderate amplitude 9.5 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During drowsiness, the posterior dominant rhythm attenuates but stage II sleep is not achieved.  Intermittent bursts of theta and delta activity are captured over the bitemporal regions.  Activity within these bursts is often sharply contoured; however, no clear sharp waves are observed within these bursts of slowing.

Stage I sleep includes an increase in beta followed by vertex waves. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving. Hyperventilation produces a small increase in the amplitude of the background.
HR:	72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features are seen.  In this individual with epilepsy, a more prolonged study capturing more extensive sleep may be helpful to identify epileptiform activity, and the beta may be due to anxiety.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is poorly responsive but this study does include wakefulness and sleep.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal and lacks all of the developmental milestones for an adult of this age. The overall background is one of theta with lower voltage slow frequency activity. Superimposed upon this there are occasional high amplitude sharp waves picked up with a generous field of spread which are primarily in the left central regions but are picked up bilaterally. When the patient drifts off to sleep, there is an increase in beta. Posteriorly predominant slow activity is noted.

HR: 96 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Replacement of the normal background with more of a beta frequency pattern with slower delta.
2. High amplitude left central spike and sharp wave activity with a generous field of spread. Sometimes this has a polyspike component
3. Occasional posteriorly predominant slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a severe bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function, but the epileptiform activity came from the left.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 8.5 hertz alpha rhythm. There is an intermittent asymmetry noted with destruction of faster frequency activity on the right compared to the left. Hyperventilation seems to accentuate this focality particularly in the right frontocentral region.
Drowsiness also seems to accentuate the focal features. Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the record.
Right frontotemporal sharp waves maximum F8 and FP2 are observed as the patient drifts off into sleep. With the use of an average reference, this activity is maximum at F8. It is so exquisitely high amplitude that it is almost negative at the midline.
The amplitude of the discharge in F8 and T2 are 80 to 103 microvolts, but it is higher amplitude particularly at F8 rather than T2.
HR: 68 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Voltages are diffusely very low. The background is symmetric.  There is right-to-left interhemispheric symmetry.  The background consists of very low amplitude diffuse fast activity without clear posterior dominant rhythm.  During hyperventilation bursts of diffuse delta are observed.  Photic stimulation does not result in change in the background.  No normal sleep architecture is captured.

MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the posterior dominant rhythm was 7-8 Hz in frequency seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is presence of low-amplitude diffuse beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  There is 6-7 Hz excess theta activity during wakefulness.  Stage 1 sleep is characterized by disappearance of the posterior dominant rhythm, slowing of the background and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact as well as the presence of vertex sharp waves and posts. Stage 2 sleep is characterized by presence of k- complexes and sleep spindles. There are occasional bursts of right temporal and central slowing, most pronounced in mid temporal region at T3 during wakefulness and sleep mixed with sharply contoured delta waves lasting for 1-3 seconds with no evolution.  During wakefulness and sleep, there are occasional bursts of generalized spike and wave discharges seen appearing with a frequency of 2.5-3 Hz, which were frontally predominant.  These occurred in bursts lasting from 1-3 seconds.  There was no clinical seizure correlate during these bursts.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and results in a symmetric driving response without any photoparoxysmal response.  Hyperventilation was performed and resulted in diffuse slowing of the background activity.  Heart rate was 72 beats per minutes.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG recording capturing wakefulness through stage 2 sleep, due to:
Generalized spike and slow wave discharges seen during wakefulness and sleep with a frequency of 2.5-3 Hz with no evolution.
Disorganized background
Excess theta activity during wakefulness and slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm.
Right central and mid temporal slowing mixed with sharply contoured wave discharges.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm and excess theta activity are consistent with encephalopathy, which could be due to toxic, metabolic, infectious, medication induced, degenerative, postictal, or bilateral cerebral dysfunction. Occasional bursts of frontally predominant generalized spike and slow wave discharges and right central and temporal slowing and sharply contoured delta waves are consistent with underlying epileptogenicity with multiple foci. The generalized beta activity could be due to medication effect including benzodiazepine, barbiturate, or could be due to anxiety or hyperthyroidism. Clinical correlation and repeat EEG or prolonged EEG monitoring for further evolution is recommended.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD. The overall EEG is relatively low voltage with a mixture of theta and delta. There is shifting asymmetry. An occasional right mid temporal sharp wave or right sharply contoured delta activity is noted in relaxed wakefulness. Simulation of the patient produces an increase in theta. There is an asymmetry in that the activity on the left seems to be a little slower, more featureless.
The right has some sharply contoured slowing in the right mid to anterior temporal sharp waves. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving, better observed on the left.
HR: 55 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Significant, bilateral background slowing.
2. An asymmetry with a more attenuated record on the left.
3. Right mid temporal sharp waves.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is primarily drowsy.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In drowsy EEG, the background includes primarily a theta frequency pattern. Despite the artifacts, once again independent right or left anterior temporal sharp waves are identified at one point relatively frequent on the right but clearly bilateral. Features of drowsiness are as described above with an increase in background slowing. Photic stimulation seems to elicit a driving response and unfortunately there is a great deal of artifact in the record:

MEDICATIONS:  Lopressor, prednisone, Lovenox, metoprolol, and Protonix. The patient is not getting Versed.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to standard 10/20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single-EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The background consists of approximately 3 second bursts of variable amplitude polymorphic delta activity.  Bursts of activity are generally poorly formed over the right.  Inter-burst interval last approximately 4-7 seconds on average, thus making burst suppression ratio approximately 1:1 to 1:3.  No normal sleep architecture is captured.  Independent bursts of polymorphic sharply contoured fast activity are captured over the left posterior temporal/posterior quadrant.  Four electrographic seizures are captured.  These seizures all differ electrographically.  The seizures occurred at approximately 11:48 a.m., 11:51 a.m., 12:03 p.m., and 12:38, and last approximately 1 minute 39 seconds, 1 minute 23 seconds, 1 minute 15 seconds, and approximately 3 minutes and 16 seconds, respectively.  First electrographic seizure starts with moderate amplitude sharply contoured fast activity emanating from the left posterior temporal region.  This activity rapidly evolves into approximately 2.5 Hz rhythmic delta that increases in amplitude and decreases in frequency and spreads to the bilateral occipital region.
Seizure number 2 starts over the left lateral leads either over the left posterior temporal region or left anterior temple region.  Seizure starts with a low amplitude discrete spikes with after-going slow waves that rapidly increase in frequency into the alpha range (approximately 11 Hz activity) and spread throughout the left temporal region and bilateral occipital regions.  This activity gradually decreases in frequency and increases in amplitude, and spreads throughout the left hemisphere.  By the end of the seizure, the seizure is characterized by approximately 1 Hz 0.3 second bursts of moderate amplitude, rhythmic, alpha activity.
Seizure number 3 is similar in appearance and evolution to seizure number 2, however, it starts over the right temporal region.
Seizure number 4 appears to start over the right anterior temporal/mid temporal region.  It starts with a 5 Hz small amplitude sharp waves with after-going slow waves that rapidly decrease in frequency.  As the seizure progresses it appears to stop over the right temporal region and start over the left posterior temporal region.  As the seizure progresses it is similar in appearance to seizure number 1.
There is no clear clinical correlation with any of the patient's seizures.  There is no clear reactivity to either noxious, tactile, or verbal stimuli.  An irregular heart rate is noted in the single EKG lead.
FINDINGS:
Burst suppression, with burst suppression ratio of approximately 1:1 up to 1:3.
Near lack of clear bursts over the right temporal region.
Four discrete electrographic seizures that differ in appearance and emanate from either left posterior temporal region, left anterior temporal region, and right anterior temporal region.
No clear evidence of reactivity.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal nearly 24-minute coma EEG due to  1:1 to 1:3 burst suppression, poorly formed bursts over the right temporal region, and 4 discrete electrographic seizures that differ electrographically and that arise from at least 3 distinct cerebral regions.  These findings indicate significant cerebral dysfunction  and if the patient is not sedative medications indicate a poor prognosis of a full neurological recovery.  These findings were conveyed to the Neurology consultant team at that time of the review.  The patient will be converted to the long term monitoring.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal, single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation and hyperventilation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal amount of frontocentral beta.  The patient reaches stage 1 and stage 2 sleep.  Activating procedures with photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.  However, during hyperventilation there is a marked abnormal response which I will describe below.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  During hyperventilation, the patient develops a nicely well-formed polymorphic delta seen at F8/T2 at 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-70 microvolts and at times with some intermixed sharply contoured activity not clearly productive formed, but suspicious.  This was only seen throughout hyperventilation again.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slowing in the right anterior temporal region accentuated by hyperventilation.

seems to be a breech rhythm with accentuation of amplitude in the right occipital region.
Vertex waves and POSTS are noted in stage 1 sleep with spindles in stage 2 sleep,
with right occipital delta. Hyperventilation increases the amplitude. Photic stimulation
elicits driving.

MEDICATIONS:  Gabapentin.
INTRODUCTION:  Activation procedure of hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  EEG was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and single EKG leads.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated 9-10 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  During drowsiness increase in the amount of theta and vertex waves are evident.  Sleep architecture is more prominent over the left hemisphere.  Occasional bursts of delta and theta activity are captured over the left hemisphere.  Additional faster frequencies over the left central occipital region captured consistent with breach artifact.  Hyperventilation increases the amount of slowing observed over the left hemisphere.  Photic stimulation results in appropriate occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.  No epileptiform discharges are captured.  Heart rate less than 60 beats a minute is occasionally observed in a single EKG lead.
FINDINGS:
Occasional mild left hemispheric slowing.
Breach primarily over the left central occipital region.
Asymmetry of sleep architecture with sleep architecture better formed over the left hemisphere.
No stage II sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal 22 minute EEG due to intermittent mild left hemispheric focal slowing.  This finding indicates underlying cerebral dysfunction that in this case is consistent with the patient's history of aneurysm and a left craniotomy. Breach effect is observed with an underlying skull defect.  No epileptiform discharges are captured.  Stage II sleep is not recorded.  If a clinical suspicion of epilepsy still persists a repeat study with sleep may be of benefit.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.

150,"REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizure.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 27-year-old with a left skull defect with a left frontal abscess removed and had seizure activity.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 to 10 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produce no abnormal discharges.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.
Heart rate:  66, normal.
Abnormal discharges:  Focal slow waves frequently seen at FP2 more than FP1 at a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz and an amplitude of 20 to 40 microvolts.
Seizures:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to frequent prefrontal right more than left slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the frontal region on the right more than the left, which is consistent with the known injury.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.

151,"CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 36-year-old right-handed woman admitted after multiple seizures and Dilantin toxicity.
MEDICATIONS:  Versed, Ativan, Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This was a difficult patient with problematic impedance and combative behavior.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The patient is primarily drowsy throughout the EEG transitioning from drowsiness to even stage II sleep with vertex waves and a suggestion of spindles.  Brief arousals produce eye opening and scant alpha activity and then the patient  transitions back to a drowsy state with theta and generous beta.
Heart rate 78 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG primarily in drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The generous beta may reflect the use of benzodiazepines.  This patient is drowsy, compatible with the clinical scenario.  No epileptiform features were identified.  No previous EEGs are available at this time for comparison.  A previous study on June 14, 2006, may be utilized for comparison.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and stage 1, stage sleep 2.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation and hyperventilation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  The patient easily and rapidly goes into stage 2 sleep in less than 10 seconds and activating procedures produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen continuously T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-70 microvolts in addition a breach rhythm seen in that region.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slowing and breach rhythm in the left midtemporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left midtemporal region, which is consistent with a known surgery and tumor resection.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  Please note that the patient did appear to easily go to sleep during the recording and clinical consideration for a sleep study is warranted.

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Keppra, Ativan, Etomidate, Fentanyl, Versed, ROCURONIUM
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is starting to emerge from paralysis and demonstrates stiffening and movements.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins, the patient is a bit quieter. Activity demonstrates a slow pattern with some rhythmic mixed theta and delta on the left with a lower voltage, slower, a bit more suppressed pattern on the right, particularly in the temporal regions.
Stimulation of the patient clearly produces an alerting with an increase in muscle as well as alpha and theta frequency activity. During the EEG, the patient starts to wake up, move around, and cough. After this, there is a more alert pattern with more theta frequency and alpha frequency activity from the left, but the right remains quite slow. By the end of the record in this very sharply contoured record, there was a suggestion of underlying sharp activity versus part of the fast activity at F3. In addition, more sharply contoured slowing is seen at T4-T6.
HR: 84 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Nearly continuous focal slowing on the right hemisphere.
2. Occasional T4-T6 sharps and question F3 sharps as well.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a severe, bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function as would be expected following the use of sedative, hypnotic medications. The focal slowing and rare sharp waves on the right are compatible with past right temporal hemorrhage. Additional evaluation of this patient's cerebral function may be needed. Ongoing EEG monitoring was undertaken to make sure no additional seizures occurred.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is awake but is suffering from a cold. Hyperventilation is deferred. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates primarily a theta frequency with 6-7 Hertz theta in the background and a 7-8 Hertz alpha rhythm. There is an amplitude asymmetry with higher amplitude in the left hemisphere compared to the right. There is some arrhythmic delta activity particularly the left posterior quadrant. Features of drowsiness include rhythmic background slowing, occasional vertex waves and some Firda. Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the record.
HR: 96bpm
IMPRESSION: EEG is abnormal due to:
1. Left hemisphere demonstrates mild slowing of the alpha rhythm.
2. Right hemisphere a bit more slowing and a little bit more arrhythmic delta activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: None of this patient's EEGs have ever demonstrated significant epileptiform activity, however, this is the best quality record to-date. That study failed to identify epileptiform activity in association with the spells. This is one of many EEGs and is the best quality of all of her studies.

He now presents with a second seizure.  The seizure is  characterized by headache, body shaking with several second loss of consciousness.  The patient is aware of his seizure.
MEDICATIONS:  Current medications include levothyroxine, Lipitor, Prilosec, metoprolol, losartan, aspirin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated 10 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During sleep, symmetrical POSTS (positive occipital sharp transients of sleep), vertex waves and sleep spindles are captured.  Hyperventilation is performed with variable effort and does not result in a significant change in the background.  Step photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.  A single EKG lead demonstrates a heart rate of fewer than 60 beats a minute with occasional premature QRS complexes.
FINDINGS:
Stage 2 sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
Bradycardia and occasional premature QRS complexes.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and asleep 27-minute EEG.  Lack of epileptiform discharges in a routine EEG does not preclude the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were performed including photic stimulation and hyperventilation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some CZ electrode artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9 to 10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures were performed.  Photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges; however, some abnormal discharges are seen during hyperventilation; see below.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  During the recording, there are various bursts of generalized slowing at 2 to 4 Hz; however, intermixed with this slowing there are discrete bursts of well-formed generalized spikes and waves at a frequency of 4.5 to 5 Hz with a very high amplitude of about 80 to 100 microvolts.  These bursts last a maximum of 3 to 4 seconds and the patient appears to be able to count during them.  There does not appear to be any clear asymmetry, either.

Continuous seizure detection software as well as bi-detection software was utilized and supplemented by a patient-activated alarm, nursing observation, and testing.  The video/EEG files were reviewed on a daily basis.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-formed posterior dominant rhythm at 9 to 10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening with a normal frontocentral beta.  All sleep stages are captured.  For the first 20 minutes, photic stimulation and hyperventilation were performed with no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Bursts of generalized spikes and waves seen at 4 to 4.5 Hz with anterior predominance and bursts of 1 to 3 seconds.  At times, the bursts seem to have a right frontal leading and at times a left frontal leading, but mainly they are symmetric.  No other focal spikes were seen.
SEIZURES:  [captured or patient event captured]:  No seizure events or patient events were captured during this first day of recording.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Bursts of generalized spikes and waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The findings in this recording are consistent with a diagnosis of idiopathic generalized epilepsy.  Although some of the bursts are asymmetric, no clear focality can be seen to suggest a primary focal lesion with secondary bilateral asynchrony.  No seizures were captured so far in the recording.

MEDICATIONS: Keppra.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is relatively drowsy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the recording begins, despite a some hat drowsy state, there is a 9.5 hertz alpha rhythm identified on the right. The left hemisphere IS remarkable for significant craniotomy defect with some double phase reversing artifact, but otherwise includes essentially continuous arrhythmic delta activity with occasional bursts of more rhythmic 2-5 hertz activity. Most of the delta is in category of 1-2 hertz. Stimulation of the patient is associated with arousal and an increase in beta frequency activity bilaterally. On occasion, there is a bit more rhythmic periodic 3-5 hertz activity on the left at T3 and T5. There is some sections with an increase in beta.
HR: 72bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Continuous focal slowing from the left hemisphere.
2. Rhythmic 3-5 hertz activity at T3-T5.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The continuous arrhythmic delta activity is compatible with structural disturbance. The rhythmic 3-5 hertz activity may represent an underlying epileptiform focus. If there are any additional concerns, a follow up study may be helpful to determine whether or not these focal features improve as the patient's mental status improves.

MEDICATIONS:  Remeron, Dilantin
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm.  In relaxed wakefulness there is some bursts of shifting slowing, but there is more prominent, left temporal focal slowing with some sharply contoured slowing and even some sharp waves noted in relaxed wakefulness. Hyperventilation seems to accentuate the left temporal focal slowing.  There is wicket activity noted in both temporal regions, but there is also a subtle, underlying left temporal sharp wave.  Later sections of hyperventilation includes some head rocking artifacts. Features of drowsiness include anterior spread of the alpha rhythm, followed by POSTs.  As the patient transitions in and out of a drowsy state, the left anterior temporal focal slowing reappears. Photic stimulation elicits a bilateral driving response.  The patient starts to drift in and out sleep during photic stimulation.
HR:    66 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal due to:
Left temporal focal slowing.
Left temporal sharp waves.
Shifting temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Left temporal focal slowing and sharp waves were identified in 2006.  There is some shifting slowing at this time, which may be an age-
related phenomenon.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using a standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. The patient reports he has not had a seizure since March.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 9.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record and produces sustained, rhythmic right frontotemporal 2-3 Hertz activity. Following this, as the patient drifts into sleep there are rare right anterior temporal sharp waves noted. The patient is awakened from sleep for photic stimulation which elicits a generally bilateral driving response which is relatively subtle but there is also rhythmic slowing and a handful of sharp waves noted during photic stimulation.

HR: 60 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Rhythmic slowing in the right temporal region.
2. Rare right anterior temporal sharp waves.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 8.7 Hz alpha rhythm of 50 microvolts with a small amount of l ow voltage frontocentral beta activity. A small amount of background theta Is noted which attenuates when the patient is stimulated. Hyperventilation produces an increase in background theta. Drowsiness follows hyperventilation and is characterized by anterior spread of the alpha rhythm and, at times, in the transition toward drowsiness, a record that is well-organized without excess theta. Vertex waves are observed In stage I sleep. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response. The patient seems to be a bit drowsy and even during photic stimulation transitions Into sleep.

HR: 78 bpm

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are sections of the record that are well-organized without excess theta. In some sections of the record, the patient appears to be excessively sleepy. These findings may have a correlation with the intermittent theta noted in the background. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat study is suggested but this study today had no focal features and no temporal epileptiform activities in contrast to other studies.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm identified at times but much of the background is rich in beta and theta frequency activity and overall the overall pattern is more of a beta theta frequency pattern. Hyperventilation produces an increase in rhythmicity of the background. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta. The overall alpha frequency in general in this individual is 8 Hz. Photic stimulation does elicit a driving response. Heart rate 60 beats per minute. At the close of the record, the patient appears to be awake briefly, maximally awake when the EEG is better organized.

HR: 60 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: Prominent excess beta and theta identified in this record but not seen continuously.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In comparison to a 2007, there is excess beta and theta. This may be due to this patient's medications. No epileptiform feature we're identified in either EEG.

Evaluate for seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Plavix, clonidine, and Ativan.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was poorly cooperative.  This is primarily an awake record.
TECHNICAL:  The bedside record was with a fair amount of artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is diffusely slow, lacking some of the normal milestones in an awake adult.  In particular, there is scant if any alpha activity.  The overall pattern is a lower voltage theta pattern, relatively featureless with smaller amounts of delta.
Heart rate 96 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:  The replacement of normal background with a relatively low voltage diffusely slow pattern.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  This is a somewhat technically challenging EEG in that there is a fair amount of muscle but no significant focal or epileptiform features were noted.

CLINICAL HISTORY: 62yo man with a history of Lung Cancer, S/P Resection, TIA, ITP, with recent TIA vs CPS
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, aspirin, hydroxyurea, Prilosec, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with an additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated moderate amplitude 10-10.5 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  This AP gradient is better formed over the right hemisphere.  During drowsiness, posterior dominant rhythm attenuates. There is continuous polymorphic, often sharply contoured, theta and delta activity captured over the left hemisphere.  This slowing is most pronounced over the left temporal region.  Additionally, the amplitude is higher over the left temporal region.  Also, faster frequencies are observed over the left temporal region.  Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.
FINDINGS:
Continuous mild-to-moderate left temporal slowing
A breach over the left temporal region.
No epileptiform discharges.
No stage II sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal awake and drowsy 21-minute EEG due to continuous mild-to-moderate left temporal slowing.  This finding indicates focal cerebral dysfunction, possibly structural in etiology.  Breach artifact is secondary to a skull defect.  No clear epileptiform discharges were captured, however, stage II sleep was not recorded.  If clinical indication for seizures persists, a repeat study with sleep may be of benefit.

MEDICATIONS:  Atorvastatin, carbamazepine, omeprazole, lisinopril, and amlodipine.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some electrode artifact, mainly over the left hemisphere, seen continuously.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 to 10 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
Abnormal discharges:
Focal sharp waves seen intermittently at F7/T3 during wakefulness and drowsiness, as well as F8/T4, also during wakefulness and drowsiness (slightly more on the left than the right).
Focal slow waves seen at F8/T4 at a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz and amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts, almost continuously throughout the recording.  In addition, there is some intermittent F7/T3 focal slowing at a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz and amplitude of 20 to 50 microvolts.
Seizures:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to bilateral anterior temporal sharp waves as well as independent focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with seizures likely arising from either anterior temporal lobes.  In addition, there is evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction which is independently seen in both anterior temporal regions, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  No seizures were seen.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. There is no hyperventilation. Photic stimulation was performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta activity. Given the history provided, there should be a craniotomy defect, although none is reported by the technician and there appears to be a breech rhythm. There is nearly continuous left anterior temporal focal slowing and left anterior temporal sharp waves. The sharp waves are noted in relaxed wakefulness. The focal slowing becomes nearly continuous as the patient becomes somewhat drowsy. Characteristics of the focal slowing include arrhythmic delta activity in the left frontotemporal region with intermittent rhythmic 3 Hz to 5 Hz activity. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response.

HR: 66 bpm and slightly irregular

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Left anterior temporal focal slowing with destruction of faster frequency activity and rhythmic theta.
2. Left anterior temporal sharp waves.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, EEG is appropriately organized for age with a 10 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta. Hyperventilation was performed early in the record and clearly accentuated frontally predominant 3-4 Hz spike and wave activity. In hyperventilation, bursts were approximately 2.5 seconds in duration, frontally predominant and symmetric. Following hyperventilation, bursts were seen typically less in a second in duration. Testing was performed during the bursts and no impairment of awareness could be demonstrated. The spike and wave discharges were seen on occasion as the patient transitioned to a drowsy state with attenuation of the alpha rhythm and an increase in beta. Deeper stages of sleep were not sustained.
Photic stimulation elicited a driving response but spike and wave discharges occurred after, not during the photic stimulation period.
Heart rate 54 BPM.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG due to frontally predominant 3-4 Hz spike and wave activity with polyspike and wave activity accentuated by hyperventilation and early drowsiness.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement and 1 channel of EKG. There was no hyperventilation or photic simulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly low voltage and is very slow. There are some technical issues with the record in addition to eye movement artifact. There are some frontal sharp waves which are of higher amplitude on the left. Unfortunately, eye movement artifacts also appear higher on the left. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta. Stimulation of patient produces little but more of theta.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Diffusely depressed with possible sharp waves in the left frontal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The background slowing could be a post ictal phenomenon or due to the patient's metabolic abnormalities. His medications, the use of Ativan, could also contribute to this pattern. If the patient does not improve a followup study should be considered.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital EEG was performed in lab using standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is slow with the posterior dominant rhythm of 7-8 Hz through a excess theta activity during wakefulness.  Drowsiness was characterized by more slowing of the background activity and loss of absence of eye blink artifact and muscle artifact.  There is right breach rhythm.  There is also almost continuous right temporal slowing with a frequency of 4.5-5 Hz.  There are occasional bursts of left temporal slowing.  There are intermittent spikes noted with maximum voltage at T4 with no evolutions.  Heart rate was 80 beats per minute and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Background slowing. Diffuse background slowing
Right breach rhythm.
Continuous right temporal slowing.
Occasional left temporal slowing.
Spikes T4(Right Temporal) occasionally with no evolution, or seizures.
CLINICAL CORRELATIONS:  Diffuse slowing is indicative of bihemispheric dysfunctions that could be due to infectious, degenerative, hypoxic ischemic, postictal, and toxic metabolic etiologies. Clinical correlation is recommended.  Right breach rhythm could be due to the history of craniotomy in the past. Continuous right temporal slowing could be due to structural lesions in the right temporal region.  The presence of spike in right temporal region is indicative of hyperexcitability of cortex in this area that places this patient at higher risk for partial seizures. Clinical correlation is recommended.

MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Dilantin, Lovenox

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a continuous pattern rich in beta frequency activity, but there is also some alpha and theta frequency activity. The patient appear.. to be drowsy with slow rolling eye movements and some slow rolling head movements. As the recording continues, additional sweat artifact is observed. Stimulation of the patient clearly produces an arousal with an increase in alpha and beta frequency activity, and even a glimpse of an alpha rhythm of 9.7 Hz.

HR: N/A
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Excess beta.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is most compatible with a sedated state. No epileptiform features were seen and there were no focal features. Additional EEG recording may be considered to more completely evaluate the activity.

201,"CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 39-year-old woman admitted on the 7th with multiple seizures.  Previous EEG is not available for comparison.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing begins, the patient is awake.  The background is diffusely slow with a mixture of theta and smaller amounts of delta.  Occasional, right or left anterior temporal spikes were noted in the background.  There are independent, right or left temporal sharp waves and spikes noted in wakefulness.  There are more noted on the right in comparison to the left.  In addition, the epileptiform activity is at times complex with an extensive field of spread or some variability in terms of maximum at T2 and/or spread to the frontal regions.  As the patient became a bit drowsy, epileptiform activity with the field of spread which included posterotemporal regions and even a polyspike component was noted.  During photic stimulation, there are independent sharp waves or spikes noted.  In addition, during the 3 Hz stimulation, there is a run of rhythmic 4 Hz activity, but without frequency evolution.  Similar activity was not seen on the left.
Heart rate 96 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Complex epileptiform activity with independent sharp waves or spikes noted from either hemisphere typically with a temporal maximum, T1 or T2, but sometimes with a polyspike component or spread to the frontal regions or occipital regions.
An unusual discharge during the 3 Hz stimulation which may have represented a subclinical seizure.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.  The epileptiform activity is more complex than is typically seen in garden variety temporal lobe epilepsy.  There is a polyspike component and a generous field of spread.  In this particular EEG, there is more epileptiform activity on the right.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation is performed.  Technically this EEG is remarkable for a great deal of muscle and motion artifact.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is somewhat poorly organized. There is also a great degree of muscle artifact.  Superimposed upon this are bursts of rhythmic and arrhythmic delta activity in the right hemisphere.   The activity from the right frontal region tends to be rhythmic delta activity.  Underlying sharp waves are noted in this sharply contoured record and include T4/C4 and FP2. Features of drowsiness include additional bursts of paroxysmal high amplitude delta with an underlying right frontal sharp wave.	Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.

HR:   84 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. 	FIRDA.
2. 	Paroxysmal slowing in the right frontal region.
3.	Sharp waves from the right, many of which are frontal, but some of which are temporal.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are similar to previous study with both a right hemispheric  process and background slowing and disorganization.  This is the first EEG in 1.5 years.  The patient had been relatively seizure free since February 2008.

CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single lead EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 58-year-old woman who presents with generalized tonic-clonic convulsions.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of moderate amplitude polymorphic 8-9 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eye opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient that is at times unstable.  Additional diffuse polymorphic theta is captured.  Additional excess diffuse beta is observed.  During sleep phase, sleep spindles and K-complexes are observed.  Intermittent, primarily independent, and rarely synchronous bitemporal moderate to high amplitude sharp waves with after slow waves are captured over the anterior temporal regions.  Phase reversal occurs over F7/T1 and F8/T2 electrodes.  Left temporal epileptiform discharges are more present and more frequent.  Additional intermittent polymorphic theta and delta are captured over the anterior temporal regions.  Hyperventilation was performed with good effort and results in symmetrical diffuse background slowing.  Photic stimulation does not result in additional abnormalities.
FINDINGS:
Mild diffuse slowing.
Excess beta.
Independent greater than synchronous bilateral anterior temporal sharp waves with after going slow waves with phase reversal over F7/T1 and F8/T2 electrodes.  No electrographic seizures.  Additionally, intermittent bitemporal mild to moderate focal slowing.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal awake and asleep 28-minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing, intermittent mild to moderate bilateral anterior temporal slowing, and intermittent left greater than right independent and synchronous bilateral anterior temporal epileptiform discharges.  Diffuse background slowing indicates etiologic and nonspecific diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Focal bitemporal slowing and bitemporal epileptiform discharges indicate focal cerebral dysfunction, with increased epileptogenic potential, structural in etiology.  Excess beta could be secondary to medication effect such as benzodiazepines and barbiturates.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a mixed theta and alpha frequency pattern. There are some sections of the record which are better organized in which there is a greater quantity of 9-10 Hz alpha activity, but other sections of the record demonstrate more significant theta. There is also an intermittent asymmetry with at times a bit slower theta on the left compared to the right as well as disruption of faster frequency activity on the left compared to the right. This can be seen in the frontocentral regions. Drowsiness is characterized by a transition more toward the theta delta pattern from the alpha theta pattern.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates an intrahemispheric asymmetry. The right hemisphere demonstrates a 9 Hz alpha rhythm in a background with excess beta and excess theta as well as a modest-degree of disorganization. The left hemisphere includes some defects perhaps due to the shape of the patient╒s skull, but arrhythmic delta activity is seen almost continuously in the left posterior temporal and central parietal region. This is particularly sharply contoured at C3 and P3. Features of drowsiness and include an increase in beta. The left parietal delta becomes higher amplitude and a more clearly defined P3 sharp wave is noted as the patient transitions into stage II sleep.
Hyperventilation accentuates the focal slowing. Photic stimulation is remarkable for artifacts in the T6 electrode but no significant driving response.
HR: 78bpm.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Focal slowing in the left central parietal region and posterior temporal region.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a 10 Hz microvolt posterior dominant rhythm.  In relaxed wakefulness and in hyperventilation, there is rhythmic 3-5 Hz activity in the right temporal region.  Some of this occurs in bursts, but without definitive frequency evolution.  The bursts of rhythmic temporal theta delta may be associated with right temporal sharp waves.  In hyperventilation, the alpha rhythm is also disrupted relative to the alpha on the contralateral side.  Features of drowsiness include accentuation of the right temporal slowing and sharp waves.  Photic stimulation elicits a driving response a little bit more vigorous on the left than the right.

system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.
OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 9.5 Hz posterior dominant
rhythm with a small amount of low voltage frontal central beta activity. Drowsiness is
characterized by anterior spread of the alpha rhythm with an increase in theta. There is
some single channel artifact picked up in the right frontal central region as the patient
becomes drowsy. In addition to this single channel artifact, there is a suggestion of
focal, rhythmic frontal theta, which persists throughout photic stimulation. Photic
stimulation elicits bilateral driving.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is somnolent and uncomfortable. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG does demonstrate posteriorly predominant delta, more so in the right posterior region than the left. On the left, there is a glimpse of an alpha rhythm identified. The alpha rhythm is, however, somewhat slow. As the recording continues, the patient is uncomfortable with head shaking from side-to-side obscuring parts of the EEG. As the recording continues, the intrahemispheric asymmetry becomes a bit more prominent particularly as the patient becomes a little drowsy and there is 11 Hz activity noted in the background on the left which is absent on the right and there is an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm discernible on the left on occasion.

285,"CLINICAL HISTORY: 50 year old right handed woman status post left MCA aneurysm repaired in 2003 with annual exacerbation of complex partial seizures and low serum levels.
MEDICATIONS: Depakote, Keppra,
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is a prolonged study for a patient who appeared to have had a subclinical seizure. She was confused during the EEG and somewhat lethargic.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal. The background from the right hemisphere is slow and disorganized. The left hemisphere includes a high amplitude breech rhythm with a left frontal sharp and slow complex with arrhythmic delta activity.
At 9:15 the patient is relatively inattentive and the technologist wraps the head. At some point essentially continuous spiking is noted in the left frontal region.
A seizure is identified at 9:19 characterized by evolution of epileptiform activity in the left frontal region, which is high amplitude with a generous field of spread. The seizure duration is from 19:13:30 to 19:19:59 suggesting that this is a relatively brief seizure. The technologist transitions from this to additional recording at 09:21. After the first event with impaired responsiveness, high amplitude left frontal spiking is noted with a breech rhythm in the abnormal background. The patient's mental status actually improves somewhat. She moves about, although she is confused. The activity remains quite slow in both hemispheres.
There was another brief build up again at 9:40. Artifacts are picked up at 9:35, but again there is prominent spiking in the background with very prominent epileptiform activity.
A third electrographic seizure occurs at 9:58:57. The patient is relatively somnolent. Stimulation of the patient does not occur during this testing, but the seizure stops by itself and as it does the patient moves about.
By the morning of the 7th, she is more consistently awake, out of bed with more rhythmic theta frequency in the background although the patterns in both hemispheres are slow.
Throughout the record, there are intermittent bursts of rhythmic delta which do not have a clear clinical correlate.
Seizure: The patient is in bed and she has just off the monitor. Her head is off the monitor. She appears to be sleepy. At  13:35 she was awake and the seizure is 12 minutes later. At 13:44 with the patient with someone at the bedside, in fact a physician examining her, the left frontal delta is prominent as are some sharp waves but she is interactive somewhat with the individual examining her. As the student leaves, the patient drifts over to the right.
The electrographic seizure is at 13:47:13 and the patient is not really moving during the event but starts to reposition afterwards.
This event is characterized by rhythmic, faster frequency activity in the left frontal and temporal region with also a beta accentuation.
After the seizure was over, the patient looks about.
HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal continuous EEG monitoring due to:
1. Well-defined electrographic seizures noted but with only one seizure In the last 24 hours of recording.
2. Left frontotemporal focus.
3. Focal slowing from the left.
4. Generalized background slowing quite marked in the beginning of the record but better at the close of the record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is diagnostic of a localization-related
mechanism for epilepsy. Additional recording may be appropriate if this patient's mental status does not improve.
HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: This section of EEG, which includes a routine 20 minute EEG, followed by 50 minutes of recording, includes multiple, brief complex partial seizures. Although the patient's mental status is abnormal, the clinical correlate for this patient's seizures includes impaired responsiveness.
INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG is performed in the LTM unit using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement. The patient has a pattern of improving mental status over the course of the day. She, unfortunately, eliminated her EEG electrodes during the overnight recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Despite the improved clinical appearance of the patient, there are electrographic seizures identified. These occur when the patient is in bed sleeping, without clinical correlate. They are associated with runs and bursts of activity.
Time: 19:0838 - Approximately 1 minute in duration.
Time: 19:5442 - Another seizure, maximum, in the left frontal and temporal region with a generous field of spread. Of note, the majority of the electrographic seizures are at approximately 8 p.m. and shortly thereafter the patient starts to remove the EEG electrodes. Of note, however, the patient did receive Versed in the morning and although there were frequent high amplitude left frontocentral sharp waves, the
recurrence of seizures was primarily many hours afterwards.
INTERVAL IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION: Electrographic seizures for this individual were well-defined with characteristic frequency evolution despite the prominent interictal sharp waves from the left frontocentral region and frontotemporal region.
INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. At least one electrographic seizure is noted but no clinical seizures are observed. The patient's mental status gradually improves over the course of the record with the patient able to eat and get out of bed as well as participate in care.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The initial sections in this epoch include a markedly slow pattern with slower delta and rhythmic theta frequency from both hemispheres and high amplitude sharp and slow or spike and slow wave complexes, many of which are frontotemporal but some of which are T1. The patient is certainly much sleepier on the 6th compared to the 7th.
By the morning of the 7th, she is more consistently awake, out of bed with more rhythmic theta frequency in the background although the patterns in both hemispheres are slow.
Throughout the record, there are intermittent bursts of rhythmic delta which do not have a clear clinical correlate.
Seizure: The patient is in bed and she has just off the monitor. Her head is off the monitor. She appears to be sleepy. At  13:35 she was awake and the seizure is 12 minutes later. At 13:44 with the patient with someone at the bedside, in fact a physician examining her, the left frontal delta is prominent as are some sharp waves but she is interactive somewhat with the individual examining her.

1. Well-defined electrographic seizures noted but with only one seizure In the last 24 hours of recording.
2. Left frontotemporal focus.
3. Focal slowing from the left.
4. Generalized background slowing quite marked in the beginning of the record but better at the close of the record.

286,"CLINICAL HISTORY:  24 year old right handed male with onset of epilepsy at age approximately 14 after a head trauma, now seizure free for 1.5 years.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Vimpat, Celexa
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  There is a small amount of background theta. Right frontal sharp waves are noted.  The sharp waves and some right frontal rhythmic slowing is accentuated by hyperventilation.
As the patient transitions to drowsiness, right frontal sharp waves are noted with a rhythmic delta activity in the right temporal region. As the patient transitions in and out of sleep, the right frontal sharp waves identified are typically maximum at F4 with variable spread to FP2 or F8.  The amplitude of the spike can exceed 70 mV.  Some of the spikes have significant spread towards the midline at FZ.  The epileptiform activity is accentuated in sleep.  The patient transitions into sleep during photic stimulation.  Despite this, a driving response is elicited.
HR:    N/A
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Right frontal sharp waves typically maximum at F4, but with variable spread.
Focal slowing in the right frontal region.  This is maximum in the frontal regions in wakefulness, but spread to the temporal regions in sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are similar to previous EEGs.  They may have been accentuated somewhat by the sleep deprivation required to obtain this EEG for a patient who lives a long distance away.  The overall characteristics of this patient's epileptiform activity is essentially unchanged.  An EKG may be warranted to assess the patient's bradycardia.

REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures and confusion.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead electrode.  The patient was recorded while lethargic.  No activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow EEG with a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches, at best, 7 Hz.  It appears to be slightly reactive to eye opening.  There is no normal frontal central beta and the patient appears to show architecture typical for stage I and stage II sleep throughout the recording.  The patient is aroused on a couple of occasions, however, the EEG does not improve markedly in the frequencies.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 mV.
There is one transient sharp wave seen maximal at T4, only once in the recording.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1.  Generalized slow waves and a single T4 sharp wave.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  The one sharp wave seen throughout the recording suggests a possible focus of irritability in the right temporal region which could be seen in patient's with localization related epilepsy.  A repeat recording for a more prolonged period may elucidate a more clear diagnosis.  No seizures were seen.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a posterior dominant rhythm of 8.5 to 9.2 Hz.  This is approximately 40 microvolts.  There are occasional bursts of shifting slowing as well as some paroxysmal bursts of bilateral 5 to 7 Hz theta.  Deeper stages of sleep are not noted.  Hyperventilation seems to produce a bit of shifting slowing.  Photic stimulation is performed as the patient is drifting off to sleep.  There is little driving response.
HR:    78 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Intermittent bursts of paroxysmal slowing.
Occasional bursts of shifting slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The findings described above were previously noted including the shifting slowing.  The features of paroxysmal slowing are nonspecific and can be seen in a metabolic encephalopathy or a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function
as can be seen in renal failure or HIV infection.  The shifting slowing may be correlated with a previous stroke.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing beings, the patient is drowsy with primarily a theta frequency background. There are bursts of frontally predominant rhythmic delta activity but there is an asymmetry with a bit more rhythmic delta from the right hemisphere compared to the left. Stimulation of the patient produces an arousal with an alpha rhythm of 9 Hz although there is asymmetry between the 2 hemispheres with the alpha rhythm.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
I. Background slowing.
2. Disorganization.
3. Occasional right greater than left frontal delta.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: The background slowing and disorganization Is more prominent than that seen in previous studies. Overall this is more of a bi-hemispheric process than a unilateral process. No epileptiform features were identified.

INTRODUCTION:  Condition of the recording:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.    Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of low to moderate amplitude 9 Hz alpha that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During drowsiness the posterior dominant rhythm attenuates and diffuse theta appears.  No Stage II sleep is recorded.  Occasional bursts of polymorphic moderate amplitude theta and delta are captured over the left temporal region.  At times the slowing appears to be sharply contoured.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Step photic stimulation results in no change in the background.
FINDINGS:
Mild to moderate focal left temporal slowing.
No epileptiform discharges.
No Stage II sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal 21 minute awake and drowsy EEG due to mild to moderate occasional left temporal slowing.  This finding indicates focal dysfunction over the left temporal region, that could be structural in etiology.  No clear epileptiform discharges are captured, however, Stage II sleep is not recorded.  If clinical indication for epilepsy persists a repeat study with sleep may be of benefit.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta activity. Hyperventilation is performed early in the record and faster frequency activity is disrupted in the right before the left. In addition, in the transition to drowsiness, faster frequency activity also drops out on the right compared to the left. There is rare isolated focal slowing in the right temporal region. In addition, there is some artifact almost always seen with the EKG but there is a suggestion of a right temporal sharp wave. However, only on one occasion can a sharp wave be identified in the right frontotemporal region, independently of the EKG artifact. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:

MEDICATIONS:  Glipizide, metformin, Cymbalta, Plavix, HIV medications.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10/20 system with addition of T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG leads.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the posterior dominant rhythm was 9-10 Hz in frequency seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude frontocentral beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  A stage 1 sleep is characterized by disappearance of the alpha rhythm, slowing of the background, and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact, as well as the presence of vertex sharp waves and posts.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and results in no driving response.  Heart rate was 80 beats per minute and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG recording capturing wakefulness through stage 1 sleep.  No epileptiform abnormalities or seizures were identified in this record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A normal EEG does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy or of intermittent seizures.  If seizures are a clinical concern, a repeat EEG capturing deeper stages of sleep or a long-term EEG monitoring may be helpful.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the record opens, there is evidence of diffuse low-amplitude activity in the beta frequency range.  There is prominent excessive beta activity in the frontal-central, central-parietal, and occipital regions.  At times, there was a very low-voltage and fragmentary posterior dominant rhythm identified that achieves 10 Hz.  This is reactive to eye opening.  Hyperventilation was performed and failed to significantly activate the tracing.  There were no ictal discharges.  There were no spikes or sharp waves.  There were no clinical events identified during this recording. Heart beat varied from 60 - 80.
IMPRESSION:  This is a mildly abnormal EEG due to diffuse low-amplitude and symmetric beta activity throughout the recording.  Diffuse low-amplitude beta activity may be seen in individuals with medications such as benzodiazepines or serotonin-reuptake inhibitors.  In addition, low-voltage diffuse attenuation of brain activity may be seen in certain dementias, such as Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and dementia pugilistic.  If clinically indicated, a repeat tracing capturing deeper stages of sleep may be helpful in assessing this patient.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low-voltage, frontal central beta activity.  Although there is a great deal of eye movement artifact, in hyperventilation and relaxed wakefulness, there is very subtle underlying focal slowing in the right mid temporal region at T1, T2, T4.  Unfortunately, this is challenging to distinguish from the patient's nearly continuous eye blinks in wakefulness.  Features of drowsiness included an increase in theta beta which is relatively symmetric.  In drowsiness, there is some wicket as the patient transitions to stage I sleep with vertex waves and then spindles.
Photic stimulation elicited subtle driving.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This acute emergency room record demonstrates a markedly abnormal but dynamic pattern. As the tracing begins, the overall background is slow, even slightly discontinuous. There is an area in the right hemisphere of irregular epileptiform activity with sharp waves or spikes maximum at T6 P4 02 but with variability. There is even a spike that starts posteriorly and then demonstrates spread to T4 T6. Some of the discharges are followed by right frontally predominant rhythmic delta. As the recording continues, there is less
in the background suppression following the spikes,  the epileptiform activity is present but does
not build up into bursts and the overall background is more continuous. In addition, at the end of the record, it is returned mixed frequency activity.

HR:	N/A


IMPRESSION:  Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
1.	A complex, polyphasic epileptiform discharge in the right posterior quadrant with variable maximum.
2. 	Right frontotemporal delta.
3. 	Background slowing.
4. 	Intermittently discontinuous record.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports an irritative process. In addition, there is focal slowing and bilateral background slowing. Correlation with clinical history is recommended.

hematoma with cranioplasty on the left today followed by possible seizure characterized
by tonic clonic activity of the eyes. The patient received Ativan and Phenytoin.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Metoprolol, Methadone, Insulin, Famotidine
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placements with 1 channel of EKG which are modified due to the
recent cranioplasty.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a mixed
frequency slow pattern with theta and shifting arrhythmic delta activity. The overall
pattern is quite slow and the focal slowing can be seen from either hemisphere. There á
Is some sharply contoured slowing again Identified from either hemisphere including the
frontal and/or temporal regions. Overall, the activity Is generally slower on the left
compared to the right.
HR: 104 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Marked background slowing.
2. Shifting slowing.
3. A pattern with slow activity on the left compared to the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This individual has demonstrated less in the way of focal
slowing on the right but this is an acute postop patient and therefore the features on the
right may be due to post surgical or medication effect. No prominent epileptiform
features were seen and there were no seizures.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. This is an sleep deprived EEG, awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In sleep, there is a beta frequency background with occasional vertex waves. In wakefulness, there is a 12Hz alpha rhythm. Hyperventilation does not activate the record. Photic stimulation produces bilateral driving with harmonic and supraharmonic driving.

HR: 66 bpm

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION; This is the second normal EEG for this individual. If the patient is thought to have epilepsy, a more prolonged study may be helpful. Alternatively capturing one of his spells may be appropriate.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a well defined, 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm. There is subtle theta in the right temporal region and a handful of bursts of sharply contoured slowing and right mid to posterior temporal sharp waves. Features of drowsiness include accentuation of the focal slowing in the right temporal region. As she becomes sleepier vertex waves are observed in stage 1 sleep. She transitions in and out of stage 1 sleep. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response bilaterally.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Focal slowing in the right temporal region.
2. Right mid temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are similar to the April 2009 and the October 2009 EEGs. They support a focal mechanism for epilepsy.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  An 82-year-old woman with seizures for the past 4 years.  The last seizure was a year ago with staring and twitching.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, temazepam, Norvasc.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using a standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior  temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  There was continuous T3 electrode artifact as well as continuous F4 electrode artifact seen throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.
There is normal frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation that produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal sharp waves seen rarely at T4 during wakefulness.
Focal slow waves seen frequently at T4, at times appearance slightly monomorphic and independently at T3, both of them at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an   amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.  Please note that at T3 there is electrode artifact which does affect the complete evaluation of the region.
HEART RATE:  66.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to right mid temporal focal sharp waves and slowing as well as independent left mid temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a  diagnosis of localization of related epilepsy with seizures likely arising from the right mid temporal region.  In addition, there is evidence of bilateral independent mid temporal focal slowing (right more than left), which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures were seen.  Please note that these findings are similar to the ones on the EEG performed on 11/04/2009, where focal slowing was seen on the right, but no sharp waves were seen.

HISTORY:  This is a 59-year-old woman with a history of epilepsy as well as childhood seizure and a previous craniotomy, left occipitoparietal craniotomy here with an EEG due to recurrent seizures.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some T3 and A2 electrode artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to diffusely slow background, however, in the limited wakefulness, she has a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontocentral beta.  The patient does appear to go into stage I deeper stages and stage II deeper stages of sleep.  However, the architecture is slightly atypical.
Activating Procedures:  Specifically, hyperventilation accentuate the abnormal discharges which I will describe in the next paragraph.  However, photic stimulation produces no abnormal discharges.

Please note that the focal slowing at times occurs in burst lasting up to 5-6 seconds that appear to be very high amplitude and with intermixed sharp waves specifically over the left hemisphere.
Heart Rate:  84, regular.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left posterior quadrant sharp waves and frequent focal slowing associated with breach rhythm as well as right mid temporal sharp waves and focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal structural dysfunction and irritability in the left posterior quadrant, which is consistent with a known lesion in that region.  In addition, there is evidence of right mid temporal focal cerebral dysfunction and irritability which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 hertz alpha rhythm.
Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record producing an increase in background slowing. In addition, the breach rhythm and focal slowing from the left hemisphere particularly frontocentral and frontotemporal is noted. There is also some shifting slowing. In hyperventilation, there is a suggestion of underlying sharp wave in the left frontocentral and frontotemporal region, but unfortunately, these areas are also seen in areas with a breach rhythm. As the patient becomes drowsy, wicket is also noted in the frontocentral and frontotemporal region, again with the same caveat of the breach accentuating the amplitude. During photic stimulation, after the 5 hertz stimulation concludes, the patient is observed to be  having ocular Twitching which does not carry an EEG scalp correlate. Photic stimulation also  elicits a driving response.
HR: 60bpm
IMPRESSION: abnormal EEG due to:
1. Focal slowing in the left frontotemporal and frontocentral region accentuated by hyperventilation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION In the context of a significant breach rhythm, epileptiform activity may be elusive to identify. A follow up study capturing sleep is important if there are additional events to more completely exclude a frontotemporal or frontocentral epileptiform focus.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is a 1-hour EEG. Photic stimulation and hyperventilation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the overall background EEG is reasonably well organized with a 10.3 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of shifting slowing. Notable in this record are just prior, during, and after hyperventilation are bursts of high amplitude frontally predominant 3-5 Hz spike and slow wave complexes. These are high amplitude, frontally predominant, symmetric, and typically occur in bursts lasting 2 seconds, but up to 3 seconds. They are symmetric, bifrontal, with a polyspike component. Features of drowsiness include vertex waves. K-complexes are noted in stage 2 sleep. Dyshormia is noted as the patient transitions into sleep. In the transition to and from sleep there is some isolated high amplitude or more subtle spike and wave complexes also observed.
Photic stimulation is remarkable for a driving response. In addition, just following 11 Hz spike and wave activity and in the intermediate/frequencies, such as 17 Hz, spike and wave activity is observed.

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Tegretol.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well-organized but somewhat slow with a 7.5 Hz alpha rhythm, a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta activity and excess theta. Technically, this is a good quality study with symmetric pattern. Occasional lambda Is noted. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving. A single left frontally frontocentral sharp wave maximum at F7, FT1 is observed in this EEG.
HR: 60bpm.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Mild background slow.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: A single sharp wave should be considered artifactual and not epileptiform if there is only one. This sharp wave, however, is well-defined with an after going slow wave. This is the third EEG for this patient and the first to demonstrate epileptiform activity which is well-defined. This appears to be a satisfactory localization of this person's epilepsy despite the shortcomings described above.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: There are bursts of theta on the left but occasionally during drowsiness is seen bilaterally. He does reach an alpha rhythm of 10.5 Hz on the right. When he has bilateral bursts, the left is greater and more sustained than the right. This is accentuated during hyperventilation. Lateral eye movements are also seen. He has episodes of 3 to 4 Hz slowing, predominantly in the left temporal region. There are positive TIRDA predominantly in the left hemisphere in the temporal region and again is accentuated during hyperventilation. As the patient becomes sleepy during the exam, there are bilateral changes with alpha rhythm on the right but is not seen on the left. Also positive WICKETS. Photic stimulation does trigger driving of the record. Again, hyperventilation does increase amplitude and accentuates theta bilaterally, left greater than right.

Photic stimulation elicits scant driving, right greater than left. Heart rate 84 BPM. At the close of the record, asymmetric eye movement artifact is identified, again primarily in the left frontal region. There is a combination of eye artifact higher amplitude on the
left than the right and some left frontocentral slowing with occasional C3 sharp waves.

HR: 84 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Interhemispheric asymmetry with lower voltage, slower activity on the left.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: The generalized slowing and the focal slowing have been
previously described and support a bihemispheric process as well as a focal, structural process on the left involving gray and white matter. Epileptiform activity was markedly reduced today compared to previous studies. No seizures were recorded.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and is in a hard collar.
Prominent craniotomy defect is noted on the left. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are
performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins, the background EEG is low voltage
with rhythmic theta frequency activity of 6 Hz, reaching 50 to 60 microvolts followed by a lower
voltage more attenuated pattern. Intermittently there is some prominent increase in beta. Later
sections of the record are remarkable for occipitally predominant delta which is of different
frequencies, a little bit faster on the right compared to the left. There is some muscle and
movement artifact but as the movement artifact slows, there is a right frontocentral small
discrete sharp and more of a right parieto-occipital periodic sharp seen intermittently in the
record. These findings and this pattern differs substantially from the initial sections of the record.
They are also associated with richer overall background.
HR: 120 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Pattern with generalized background slowing alternating with more of an irregular pattern
with posterior sharp waves or periodic delta.
2. Posterior periodic complexes or sharp waves.
3. Intermittent background attenuation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a severe disturbance of cerebral dysfunction.
Of note, while the majority of this patient's trauma is on the left, it is likely that the seizures are
emanating from the right hemisphere given the clinical description of ictal left gaze deviation and
the epileptiform features reported.

INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10á
20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient1s quite obtunded but has
some cranial nerve findings.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begin s, the background EEG is markedly
suppressed. There is a lower voltage subtle, periodic delta with a-sharp wave mixed in. This
sharp wave is picked up at T2, T4-C4, perhaps maximum at T4-C4. Stimulation of the patient
on 1 occasion produces a clear change in the background with rhythmic periodic activity. In
addition, there is some sustained periodic discharge in the right hemisphere, which seems to
have an admixed right central temporal sharp wave. Looking at the video, it appears that the
patient has movement of the right thoracic region In association with this. This discharge Is brief
and subsides on its own. A second, remarkable discharge Is identified with sharp activity
present bilaterally but clearly maximum in the right hemisphere. On this occasion, the video
does not identify a clinical correlate and this second event is without a doubt an electrographic
seizure. In total, there are 3 well-defined electrographic seizures noted in !he record. One of
!hem seems to be stimulus sensitive and other 2 did not have clear clinical correlates.
HR: 120-150 bpm
IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Three electrographic seizures.
2. interictal pattern of marked background suppression.
3. Epileptiform activity, which Is primarily on the right but is complex in nature.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a severe disturbance of cerebral function. It
also demonstrates a very irritative focus on the right. Ongoing EEG monitoring was requested
to determine the patient's response to therapy.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. The patient is intubated and febrile as described above. Current body temperature 103.8.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG does demonstrate a preserved cerebral pattern. There is low to medium voltage, mixed frequency primary theta frequency activity of 5.4 hertz, but there is also some 3.5 hertz delta activity and smaller amounts of beta. In this video study, the patient is postured with his head looking to the right. The big EEG machine and video camera are on the left. The camera demonstrates intermittent jerking of the chest and this correlates with some muscle artifact seen diffusely through the EEG. The brief jerks of muscle artifact are not clearly associated with epileptiform activity. There is a suggestion of a vertex sharp wave seen independently of the jerks and on 1 or 2 occasions, as the recording continues, there does appear to be a slow wave that follows some of the jerks. There is a small degree of discontinuity.

HR: 144 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. A primarily theta/theta delta pattern following cardiac arrest.
2. High amplitude myoclonic jerks, but some of these seem to have an after going slow wave.
3. Vertex sharp waves.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: The presence of an after going slow wave would suggest that the myoclonus is epileptiform in nature. Additional intervention may be appropriate.

439,"CLINICAL HISTORY: 60 year old right handed gentleman with epilepsy, seizure-free
for the past 20 years.

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Depakote, Nexium

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a
symmetric reactive alpha rhythm. The alpha is 8.5 Hz In frequency but there is a small
amount of11 Hz activity in the background. Features of drowsiness include an increase
in beta. Slow-rolling eye movements and attenuation of the record characterize the early
stage I sleep record followed by lower voltage vertex waves. Hyperventilation does not
active the record. Photic stimulation elicits low voltage driving pattern.

HR: 72 bpm

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: There was generous background beta identified in this
record compatible with the patient's phenobarbital. This was not a sleep deprived nor
fasting record. Additional studies performed fasting and/or sleep deprived may be
needed to characterize what has been described as a primary generalized epilepsy for
this individual.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is confused.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates an interhemispheric asymmetry. There is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm on the right. The right hemisphere demonstrates generous beta, a small amount of disorganization, and excess theta. The left hemisphere includes a great deal of muscle and motion artifact, but includes nearly continuous arrhythmic delta activity with sharp waves mixed in. In addition to the sharp waves, there are features that suggest that this is an ongoing, ictal pattern, and that the activity in the left mid temporal region waxes and wanes. Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta frequency activity. The record has ongoing sharp waves and rhythmic mixed theta delta, but not the same frequency evolution as when the patient started to become sleepy. He is awakened for photic stimulation. Again, there is a bit more rhythmic theta and the sharp waves. No definitive photic driving is noted.
HR: 150 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Nearly continuous, rhythmic sharp waves, rhythmic theta from the left anterior temporal region.
2. Focal slowing from the left anterior temporal region.
3. Excess beta from the right.
4. Mildly disorganized on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a highly epileptogenic focus. Additional evaluation to make sure that this is an ongoing ictal pattern is suggested.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a significantly slow pattern on the right with lower voltage, mixed theta delta pattern. The left hemisphere demonstrates arrhythmic delta activity with high amplitude epileptiform activity with complex field of spread including posterior temporal. Some of the epileptiform activity is at the vertex. Much of it appears at PZ or T5. There is an electropositivity at CZ that marches through in the averaged reference with an electronegativity P3T5. In addition, there are other wave forms that are actually electronegative and maximum at PZCA compatible with very complex epileptiform activity. The highest amplitude activity is a left posterior temporal spike focus. The epileptiform activity occurs. as frequent but relatively isolated discharges which do not evolve, although the activity at CZPZ does seem to have more of a rhythmic pattern. Photic stimulation does not appreciably change the EEG.

pattern with prominent of generalized polyspike and wave activity as well as spike and wave activity. In some locations a bit of a polyspike can be noted in the right frontocentral region but on the whole the activity is quite symmetrical. There are brief periods of attenuation or suppression lasting to 3 seconds. On occasion there is a little bit of focality as the activity resumes with some suggestion of a bit more theta on the right. In the frontotemporal regions, however, the activity is bit more prominent on the left. Tactile stimulation of the patient does not activate the record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a markedly abnormal pattern. The activity from the left hemisphere is markedly suppressed and slow. There is a breach rhythm identified on the right. In addition, throughout much of the record the activity is quite slow in the right frontal region but there is some beta accentuation in the right frontal region as well as a somewhat periodic sharp wave maximum at 4. Stimulation of the patient does produce some artifact as well as a small amount of rhythmic activity in the right hemisphere but this is difficult to discern at the left hemisphere and at both hemispheres, the use of slow paper speed is necessary to see changes. There is variability in the right hemisphere.

MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Metoprolol, Lovenox, Diovan, Zocor
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. The patient is relatively somnolent.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is composed primarily of theta frequency activity with superimposed arrhythmic delta activity. The arrhythmic delta activity is more prominent in the right hemisphere with some sharply contoured activity in the right mid posterior temporal region. There is an amplitude asymmetry with higher amplitude activity on the right and some sharp waves on the right. The activity from the left is lower voltage and a little bit more uniform. As the patient drifts off to sleep, delta is identified on the left before the right.
HR: 66 bpm and irregular with frequent PVCs.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Superimposed poor organization.
3. Amplitude asymmetry with higher amplitude activity on the right.
4. Right sided sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a bihemispheric disorder affecting both gray and white matter. Correlation with imaging is suggestive. In addition, the epileptiform activity may be correlated with his stroke or previous head trauma.

MEDICATIONS: Lasix, Metoprolol, Keppra, Pantoprazole
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and poorly responsive. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the patient is intubated and unresponsive. There is prominent frontal delta present bilaterally but which is more prominent and more sharply contoured in the left frontal region. Ativan is administered and by 4:04, the EEG starts to show an improvement with more of a beta and theta frequency pattern. There is low voltage frontal delta, but the activity is abating and it is not as periodic or as high amplitude.
HR: 140 bpm
IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
1. An initial pattern which is probably a late ictal pattern with rhythmic repetitive frontal delta bilaterally left-sided maximum.
2. Generalized background slowing at the end.

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, ASA, Plavix, Lasix, Benadryl, Dilaudid
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. This EEG is recorded at multiple sections.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: EEG characteristics of the seizures include rhythmic, repetitive, theta frequency, activity primarily from the left hemisphere including left frontotemporal. Some of this also involved delta. Most seizures seem to be about 2 minutes in duration and demonstrate frequent evolution. There is little in the way of postictal confusion, and the postictal background is actually quite symmetric with a definable posterior dominant rhythm. The degree of focal slowing in the left hemisphere is quite variable. Photic stimulation does not activate the record. During the later portions of the record, because the patient is having recurrent seizures, the technologist switches over the electrodes to collodion one-by-one during the continuous record. The seizures are characterized by head turning and confusion. The patient is aphasic but she is communicative before and after the seizures, and even during the seizures she seems to be making an attempt to communicate. Clinical features of the seizures include tremulousness of the hand. The right hand comes up to the mouth. She seems more confused.
HR: 96 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Recurrent complex partial seizures.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Although the patient's mental status does return to normal, the presence of repetitive seizures meets the diagnostic criteria for status epilepticus. The patients LTM was reviewed up to 17:00 hours. By the time she got over to long-term monitoring, the seizures seemed to were slowing and the focal slowing on the left seemed to be improving.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed In lab using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a dynamic pattern.
Some sections are low voltage with a posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz and some generous
beta and some theta. Other sections include more of a theta frequency background. There are sustained bursts of rhythmic, sharply contoured 5 Hz paroxysmal activity maximal in the frontal regions. Some of these seem to have frequency of late evolution. Some seem to start with a sharp wave in the right or left frontal region. On one occasion, one of these more sustained bursts seems to be associated with startling and the patient puts her hand over her mouth. On other occasions, however, it is difficult to say that the bursts are associated with any change in behavior. The technologist taps the patient during one of the events and the patient alerts and the 5 Hz activity disappears.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. An unusual pattern with an almost normal-appearing background alternating with a beta
theta pattern.
2. Paroxysmal bursts of higher amplitude activity in the frontal regions which demonstrate
frequency evolution with 5 Hz activity evolving to 8 Hz and then slowing as the discharges wane.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: I n this challenging patient, the possibility that at least some of
these bursts can represent subtle seizures Is Important to consider. This EEG supports a diffuse

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is slow with a mixture of theta and delta. There are some shifting asymmetries as well as single channel artifact. There is a suggestion of a poly spike focus in the left posterior region, T5 O1. When the patient is unstimulated, he drifts off to sleep with an increase in background slowing. The area with fast activity and small discrete sharp waves continues into the sleep pattern. Other features of drowsiness or sleep include an increase in beta. The patient arouses spontaneously, but remains confused. Occasional FIRDA is observed.
HR: 120 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing.
2. Left occipital temporal sharp wave focus with poly spike activity.
3. FIRDA.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function effecting both gray and white matter. The focal epileptiform activity may be correlated with imaging. Followup studies and correlation with imaging may be of value.

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Ativan, Keppra.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record in an individual who is quite sleepy. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient is quite drowsy at the beginning of the record with an overall slow background with delta and smaller amounts of theta. There is a suggestion of an asymmetry with a little slower activity on the right than the left. The background EEG is abnormal and includes primarily a theta frequency pattern with a glimpse of an alpha rhythm. The alpha rhythm is somewhat slow at 7Hz.

There are focal epileptiform features observed in this record. These include discrete high amplitude right anterior temporal spike and slow wave complexes, right occipital spike and slow wave complexes and some bifrontal sharp waves, left higher amplitude than the right.

Hyperventilation seems to accentuate the epileptiform activity from the frontal and occipital regions. Photic stimulation does not produce a driving response but may also accentuate the epileptiform activity.

As the recording continues, the patient starts to arouse spontaneously with an 11 Hz alpha rhythm and a background with excess beta. Intermittently a bit of rhythmic slowing is observed in the right hemisphere particularly the posterior temporal.

Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is asleep and does not significantly activate the record. Toward the close of the record, there is a suggestion of sharp waves on the right, but unfortunately there is also electrode artifact.

HR: 96 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Abnormal background.
2. Focal epileptiform activity including frontal, temporal or occipital.
3. Excess beta.
4. Initially excess slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: There is certainly a suggestion of slowing on the right, however, there are some technical limitations of this record. To more completely evaluate this patientÕs underlying epilepsy, a followup study is suggested.

The epileptiform activity described today has been previously noted. Of note, the temporal epileptiform activity is much more prominent. No occipital seizures were noted and the patient is not experiencing refractory headaches at this time.

placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. The patient Is
agitated during the EEG and receives Ativan.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins, the background is a bit slow when the patient
becomes agitated, he wakes up and there is a prominent 12. hertz alpha rhythm noted bilaterally.
Approximately 10 seconds Into the arousal state with the bilateral alpha as the patient becomes agitated,
more rhythmic4-5 hertz activity emerges from the left central and parietal regions. The behavior of of the
patient is difficult to observe because the caregiver is trying to restrain the patient. The patient is
described as agitated and poor1y responsive by the caregiver during the seizure. He seems to have
looked to his right during the seizure although the caregiver approaches from the left obscuring the view.
A second seizure occurs and again Is characterized by first a somewhat slow background and then in this
case at 16:56:05, a burst of bilateral fast activity following the appearance of the theta on the left at
16:56:11 and then as this occurs, there is more fast activity bilaterally, more clear evidence of a breach
with higher amplitude fast activity more so on the left than the right and then more definitive frequency
evolution is noted at 16:57:11 as the patient postures through to the right with head turning to the right
and what seems like a decorticate or dystonic posturing of the right hand more so than the left. He also
has some irregular respirations and then some clonic activity. There is a problem with the EEG and the
EEG stops recording although the video continues through the end of the seizure. The technologist
attempts to fix the EEG problems while the patient seems to have had a 3rd seizure during the EEG. A
4th event is noted at 17:04:44 again with the patient turning to the left and this seems to merge onto a 5th

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient reports feeling anxious at the start of the study. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the background EEG opens, the patient has generous background beta. There is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm with rhythmic activity in the right temporal region. For some reason, there is a pause in the EEG at the beginning of the record. The patient is staring forward. When the EEG resumes at 1:27:01, there is artifact, but the minute that the artifact stops, the EEG demonstrates a clear, high amplitude, right anterior temporal seizure with 4 to 5 Hz activity in the right temporal region with an admix spike.

The activity is extremely high amplitude with a phase reversal at F8 and T2. The activity ends abruptly at 1:38:56. The overall duration of the seizure appears to be approximately 3 minutes but the seizure onset is unclear. By the end of the seizure, the activity is involving the right frontal region and also the midline and to a lesser extent the left frontal region.

There is occasional, slightly irregular slowing in the temporal regions, notched, 5 Hz activity is noted in the frontal region which is typically symmetric and bilateral. Features of drowsiness could an increase in background stowing. Vertex waves are identified in stage I sleep. Hyperventilation is performed with good effort producing bursts of rhythmic frontal activity which is somewhat sharply contoured. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving. The primary abnormalities in this record are frontal or frontocentral sharp and slow waves. This occurs on rare occasions.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  63 year-old man with history of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, multiple previous strokes presents with a seizure on 10/21/2011, and post ictal confusion.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Tylenol, Prozac.
REASON FOR PROCEDURE:  Confusion.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system in addition to anterior temporal and EKG electrodes.  Wakefulness and sleep were recorded.  Photic stimulation was performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow EEG which is mainly in sleep, stage I and stage II.  There is a brief amount of wakefulness which is elicited after the technician stimulates the patient with sternal rub and noxious stimulation to the nose.  During that time, the patient actually responds and opens his eyes.  Upon eyes closing the best posterior dominant rhythm achieved is 7 Hz with a 20 to 60 microvolt amplitude.  There is some frontal central beta seen.  Activating procedures with photic stimulation reveal no abnormal discharges; however, stimulation does improve the frequency of the EEG but it never reaches normal background.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz in wakefulness and 20-60 microvolts amplitude.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures nor epileptiform activities were seen.  Please note that this report is likely different than previous, where focal slowing has been seen.  This may be due to overall diffuse cerebral dysfunction and medication effect.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal and
includes a rhythmic mixture of delta and theta frequency activity.

There is a frontally predominant periodic complex which is asynchronous. The field for the discharge is unusual and in the right frontal region, it has an anterior to posterior lag as a triphasic wave might have, but is not identical in the left hemisphere and using an average reference, it is most prominent in the frontal regions FP1 and FP2 with an anterior to posterior lag. In some cases, it is maximum at FP1, clearly higher amplitude and on other occasions, a bit more prominent at FP2. Initially, stimulation of the patient produces an increase in muscle.

Ativan is given during the EEG and produces a slowing of the background. After the Ativan, the periodic activity begins to abate and is most prominent in the right frontal region.

At 12:23:40, the periodic activity to abruptly terminates and the EEG transitions to a alpha theta background. Following the Ativan the EEG was improved dramatically.

HR: 76 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Marked background slowing.
2. Triphasic waves
3. Complex periodic activity some of which appears to be epileptiform in nature, but others which are more focal and have unusual morphology.


CLINICAL CORRELATION: Features of this record support a metabolic encephalopathy, however, the dramatic improvement with the use of benzodiazepine suggest that the discharges are more likely to represent a late form of status epilepticus.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is awake, staring. There is no mention as to the exact location of his craniotomy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The normal morphology of an awake adult are absent in this record, which is primarily low voltage beta. There is some rhythmic artifacts. Eye movement artifacts are out of phase, raising the possibility of disconjugate eye movements. There is some rhythmic delta in the right posterior quadrant. Stimulation of the patient produces muscle artifact. As the recording continues, the eye movements are more symmetric. When the patient is unstimulated as the recording continues, the overall pattern is one of delta and theta with a featureless pattern, particularly missing faster frequency activity with slower, more rhythmic delta activity in the right occipital region and then less rhythmic delta in the left occipital region. Stimulation of the patient increases eye movement artifact.
HR: 130 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Very slow, featureless, background.
2. An asymmetry in the occipital regions with more rhythmic slowing on the right and more arrhythmic slowing on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed. This EEG supports a significant disturbance of cerebral function, which may be chronic particularly in that the patient at least has eye opening and eye movement with some degree of interactivity. Technically this is better quality than the previous study.

665,"CLINICAL HISTORY: 81 year old gentleman with a long history of multiple sclerosis and CT scans demonstrating chronic prior strokes and status epilepticus earlier this morning.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Ativan, Metoprolol
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is wearing a nonrebreather face mask, has eyes open but is not very interactive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The initial sections of the record demonstrate a very low voltage pattern with generous muscle and beta. As the recording continues, the patient is a little bit more awake and there is a bit more low voltage theta. Shifting arrhythmic delta activity is identified from either region and there is some sharply contoured slowing at F7T3 and in the right central region CZ-C4. Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in muscle and an increase in beta.
HR: 84 bpm and irregular
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Replacement of normal background with a relatively low voltage pattern rich in beta and theta.
2. Shifting arrhythmic delta activity.
3. Rare sharp waves noted from either hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These are relatively simple in morphology and may be correlated with imaging. No seizures were recorded.

MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Dilantin, Propofol, Zofran, Vancomycin, Zosyn

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. From the best Information that can be determined, the patient has not been in barbiturate coma since last week.

DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a burst suppression pattern with bursts of faster frequency activity, bursts of theta frequency activity, and an amplitude asymmetry sometimes higher amplitude on the right compared to the left Tactile stimulation of the patient does not particularly change the record. Average duration of suppressions is 1-3 seconds and average duration of cerebral activity tends to be around 3 seconds. The overall pattern is not completely flat. Rare sharp waves are observed. The physical examination demonstrates an intubated comatose patient and it is not possible to determine if the patient has eye deviation during the EEG.

HR: 75 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Discontinuous bursts suppression pattern.
2. Low voltage pattern.
3. Rare sharp waves.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: If in fact the patient is receiving sedative hypnotic doses of propofol, then that would certainly account for the burst suppression pattern obtained.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background demonstrates a lower voltage mixed frequency theta delta pattern from the left with ongoing sharp waves and spikes from the right hemisphere which can be anterior temporal or posterior temporal or central temporal. There is frequency evolution of the epileptiform activity, but no clinical seizures. The right hemisphere also demonstrates significant background slowing. Tactile stimulation of the patient does not activate the record.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Marked background slowing.
2. Absence of reactivity to tactile stimulation.
3. Prominent ongoing PLEDS plus from the right hemisphere with some frequency evolution.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were observed. If additional information is needed, a followup study may be considered.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10.7 hertz alpha rhythm
of 40 microvolts with a small amount of focal, frontocentral beta. Features of drowsiness
include anterior spread of the alpha rhythm and an increase in beta. In addition, the eye blink artifact and skull defect, rocking artifact, there is intermittent rhythmic 2-3 hertz slowing in the left frontotemporal region. That slowing is accentuated by drowsiness and hyperventilation. Photic stimulation elicits a supra harmonic driving response.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Although the patient is described by observers as being unresponsive, he appears to be lightly sedated with an 8.8 Hz alpha rhythm and subtle eye movement. More clear eye movement is associated with attenuation of the alpha rhythm. There appears to be some electrode artifact with a beta accentuation in the right frontal region. Tactile stimulation including painful stimulation does not activate the record. Sternal rub produces sternal rub artifact.

HR: 96 bpm.

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no focal nor epileptiform features observed in the record. In addition, when the physician examines the patient at the bedside, eye opening and eye closure occur and the alpha is clearly reactive. Other possible causes for this patient's apparent responsiveness should be considered.

INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Posterior dominant rhythm reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontal central beta seen best over the left hemisphere.
Activating procedures, including photic stimulation, produce no abnormal discharges.  Some drowsiness and stage 1 sleep could be seen.
Heart rate:  72.
Abnormal discharges:
Frequent sharp waves are seen at F8/T4 with a field that sometimes goes to F4.  At the same time sharp waves are also seen at F7/T3 with also a frontal field at times that may even spread to FP1.
Focal slow waves are seen over the entire right hemisphere with associated attenuation which appears to be maximal at F8/T4 with a frequency of 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20 mV.
Focal slow waves are also seen over the left hemisphere at F7/T3 intermittently at a frequency of 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-60 mV.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the overall background is relatively low voltage with a scant, 8 Hz alpha rhythm and generous beta. Hyperventilation is performed early in the record producing an increase in the amplitude of the background. Following hyperventilation as the patient drifts off to sleep, there is an increase in beta, rare bursts of temporal slowing followed by vertex waves and posts. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.

HR: 72 bpm

IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are observed in this record. This EEG is within the limits of normal. It is overall a lower voltage pattern. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow-up study may be considered. In addition, repeat studies may be helpful in monitoring the patient's cerebral pattern in the context of dementia/delirium.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The overall EEG includes a low voltage pattern, which includes primarily slower delta frequency activity of 2 to 3 Hz, a small amount of theta, and a small amount of alpha frequency activity, particularly in the frontocentral region. There is no well-defined alpha rhythm. Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing with some hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing followed by vertex waves. There is also some more sharply contoured high amplitude slowing in this bedside recording in the parietal occipital regions, a little bit more prominent at P3.

MEDICATIONS: Zocor, Vancomycin, Acyclovir, Keppra, ASA, Aricept, Bactrim, Moxifloxacin, Insulin, Lovenox, Dexamethasone, Ceftriaxone, Levothyroxine, dopamine, Norepinephrine

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient had a seizure just prior to the EEG.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This EEG demonstrates some low voltage, subtlety discontinuous background. Some attenuation of about 3 seconds are interspersed with periods of low voltage, mixed theta delta. As the recording continues, the EEG is more continuous. There is some shifting asymmetries with more attenuation on the left compared to the right.

Seizure: The patient is in the ICU at the bedside. She starts to have rhythmic mixed theta delta out of the left hemisphere, particularly the temporal region at 10:36:43. This gradually builds up, but at 10:36:55 she starts to have a burst of fast activity out of the right hemisphere. The bursts of fast activity builds up exquisitely, while the left hemisphere as a different frequency of activity with rhythmic delta. This is followed by more of a generalized pattern characteristic of more of a tonic clonic pattern, although behaviorally the patient is only observed to be having facial and head twitching. The activity starts to slow at 10:37:41. As it stops, it shuts off at 10:38 on the right, but continues on the left before terminating abruptly at 10:38:20. Postictally there is prominent background suppression as was noted in the early portions of the record.

HR: 162 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. A markedly abnormal background starting out with burst suppression pattern and actually ending with a burst suppression pattern.
2. A very complex seizure, which likely began on the left, generated to the right, with different frequencies of activity from the different hemispheres and a differential termination of the procedure.
3. Following the seizure there are handful of sharp waves on the left.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a severe underlying encephalopathy, as well as very unusual mechanism for epilepsy. This seizure pattern is more typical of a chronic epilepsy than acute reactive seizure.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient is awake and cooperative. The overall
background is slow, disorganized with primarily a theta frequency background. Lambda is noted
in the background. Independent bursts of high amplitude, sharp waves of approximately 160
microseconds and greater than 100 millivolts are identified in brief bursts typically lasting less
than 10 seconds from the right or left temporal region. The sharp waves also occur individually
and there are some sharply contoured slowing. Features of drowsiness include an increase in
beta activity. The epileptiform activity has a more extensive field of spread into the anterior
temporal regions in drowsiness and even into T6/02 as the patient becomes sleepy. This
phenomenon is also seen on the left with more and more of a mid to posterior temporal
localization as the patient drifts off to sleep. Photic stimulation does elicit a driving response. It
increases the epileptiform activity which is, however, quite prominent during photic stimulation.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the patient is resting in bed. The background EEG is somewhat disorganized and is comprised primarily of rhythmic theta frequency activity with smaller amounts of underlying delta. Much of the theta frequency activity is 7 Hz with smaller quantities of5.5 Hz activity. Intermittent coughing is observed. It is not specifically associated with a change in-the background. There ate occasional bursts of arrhythmic delta activity identified from either hemisphere. Stimulation of the patient does not particularly impact the record. The record is not long enough to record definitive sleep cycles.

HR: 60 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Replacement of normal background primarily with a theta frequency pattern.
2. Underlying arrhythmic delta activity.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed. If appropriate, a longer study to identify sleep/wake cycles may be of value. An alternative would be to consider SSEPs.

MEDICATIONS: Bactrim and inhaler.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is abnormal. The background is primarily rhythmic theta with smaller amounts of delta. The definable posterior dominant rhythm is 5 Hz in a background with theta and delta. There are bursts of frontally predominantly spike and wave complexes noted in relaxed wakefulness. These are slightly asynchronous. Most are 3-5 Hz and in relaxed
wakefulness the bursts of generalized spike and wave activity are 1-3 seconds in duration. There are also some independent, isolated right or left temporal sharp waves noted in the background.
Hyperventilation is performed and produces an increase in the activity. In addition, during hyperventilation the patient complains of rapid or prominent heart rate.
Her baseline heart rate exceeds 100 beats per minute and in fact averages 110, actually dropping briefly to 96 during hyperventilation and then returning to tachycardia. Brief drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic slowing with spontaneous arousals. Lambda is observed in wakefulness.
Photic stimulation does elicit a driving response with supraharmonic driving at 11 Hz. In addition, there is a suggestion of a photo paroxysmal response as well. This is more clearly defined with frontally predominant polyspike activity with 19 Hz photic stimulation.
HR: 120 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Frontally predominant spike and wave activity.
2. Background slowing and disorganization.
3. A suggestion of focal epileptiform activity.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This patient's frequent seizures may contribute to the background disorganization. The epileptiform activity may represent a primary generalized or secondary generalized focus. Additional recording may be helpful following initiation of treatment.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. The patient has a trach and is poorly responsive.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG initially demonstrates a very low voltage suppressed pattern. Superimposed upon this, are-sharp waves in the right hemisphere which typically start in the right posterior quadrant and end in the right anterior region. They seem to occur as a couplet and with posterior sharp waves first and then an anterior sharp wave which follows and can occur up to a second later. In some cases, this seems to occur a second and a half later, but the epileptiform activity typically seems to occur with 2-3 discharges at a time. Over the course of the record, there is an improvement in the background with an increase in beta and alpha frequency activity. The epileptiform activity remains relatively in variant.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation was completed.
This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness there is a 10 Hz 40-50
microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central
beta activity. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta and theta frequency
activity. Vertex waves are identified in stage 1 sleep. Photic stimulation elicits scant
bilateral driving. On occasion in transition to sleep there is a small amount of shifting
theta in the left or right temporal region.
HR: 108 bpm
IMPRESSION: Very mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Scant amount of shifting theta in drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are typical of those seen in an older adult.
They are quite nonspecific and can be correlated with imaging and clinical course. This
is the second EEG for this individual. Neither EEG has demonstrated epileptiform
activity. In view of the patient's complaint of headaches, these findings may be
correlated with imaging.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is obtunded.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is abnormal and includes a mixture of delta and theta activity. In addition, there are posteriorly predominant sharp waves which could be seen in 02, 01 and T5. Occasional triphasic waves are noted. Stimulation of the patient produces increasing theta.

HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Sharp waves in 01, T5 and 02.
2. Slow background with a mixture of theta and delta.
3. Occasional triphasic waves.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: The background slowing supports an underlying encephalopathy. The sharp waves in the posterior region may represent a large area of epileptogenicity or an unusual field of spread. Correlation with imaging is advised.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient has scalp laceration which impacts electrode placement. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a rhythmic mixture of theta and delta. There is a subtle asymmetry best identified in the right central parietal region with attenuation of activity in that region. Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in faster frequency activity.

HR: 110 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Rhythmic background slowing.
2. A more subtle, superimposed asymmetry with lower voltage and slightly slower activity in the right central region.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed. The focal features described above are quite subtle and, in fact, comparing the central regions bilaterally, the central regions are slower than the temporal regions. This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrodes placement with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is sometimes quite disorganized but at other times there is a 10.3 Hz alpha rhythm, which is disrupted on the left compared to the right.
There is a sharp wave identified in the left hemisphere which is at times periodic, at times prominent. The sharp wave has an unusual field of spread and may be electropositive in the anterior temporal region but in bipolar montages seems to almost have a double phase reversal, comparing the occipital and parietal regions. There
seems to be some electropositivity in the central or parietal region.
Arousal of the patient produces an increase in organization, although there is some focal slowing that remains on the left. Photic stimulation elicits a scant driving response, which is better organized on the right. Arrhythmic delta activity can be seen in the left temporal region, as well. Features of drowsiness included increase in rhythmic frontal delta.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation, were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a background with absence of a clear posterior dominant rhythm and a very low amplitude voltage recording.  There is a preponderance of diffuse beta seen throughout the recording.  Otherwise there was normal sleep architecture seen in stage I and stage II.  Activating procedures produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Some focal slow waves are noted at F3/C3 with some increase in faster frequencies at times in that region consistent with a breech.  The slow waves are noticed mainly at 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-40 mV.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Left frontal central slowing and breech.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left frontal central region which is consistent with the known surgery.  The absence of normal posterior dominant rhythm, although atypical, could be a normal variant.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz, 50 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm. In wakefulness there are also right anterior temporal sharp waves. During the hyperventilation part of the record there is an area of initially a low voltage, slightly irregular slowing out of the right central temporal region, followed by more rhythmic activity of initially 2-3 Hz, and then higher amplitude activity of increasing
rhythmicity in hyperventilation, which is in the right central temporal region. This activity out of the right central region occurs in the context of generalized, frontally predominant rhythmic slowing. In the post hyperventilation record, there is prominent rhythmic 7 Hz activity out of the left central region and then more definitive Mu like activity which can be seen bilaterally. The activity that looks like Mu on the left Is a lower voltage from that on the right, although the frequency is identical. Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta frequency activity. Photic stimulation elicits supraharmonic driving.
HR: 66 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Rare right temporal sharp waves.
2. Subtle underlying focal slowing in the right central temporal region.
3. An unusual Mu activity that is slower that it is typically expected in higher amplitude  on the right.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: The sharp waves should be correlated in this patients history, but support a focal mechanism for epilepsy.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background includes 9.7 Hz alpha rhythm. This is better represented on the left compared to the right. MU activity is identified, again better represented on the left than the right. Focal delta is noted in the right temporal region as well as a prominent craniotomy defect with double phase reversing artifact. There is some sharply contoured slowing with a phase reversal at T6. Posts are noted in stage I sleep. Vertex waves, K complexes and spindles are noted in sleep, and in fact the focal slowing and the sharply contoured slowing is much less prominent in sleep. Photic stimulation is performed in individuals in stage II sleep and does not clearly activate the record. Hyperventilation seems
to accentuate the focal features.
HR: 78bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Continuous focal slowing from the right temporal region with disruption of faster frequency activity.
2. Disruption of both alpha and MU rhythms on the right.

MEDICATIONS: Norvasc, Lovastatin, Buspar, ASA, Amlodipine, Benazepril

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and brief drowsy record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 10Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta activity. Brief drowsiness is characterized by some rhythmic theta. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude and background photic stimulation elicits scant driving.

HR: 84 bpm

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are observed. A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy and if seizure is an important consideration, a prolonged study with additional sleep may be valuable.

MEDICATIONS: Metoprolol, Lisinopril, Xalatan, Amlodipine
Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.3 Hz alpha rhythm with
a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta activity. Drowsiness is characterized by
slowing of the alpha rhythm. Hyperventilation does not significantly activate the record.
Hypersynchronous, rhythmic slowing is noted as the patient transitions into deeper
stages of sleep and then the patient is alerted for photic stimulation. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features were observed. This
individual has some hypersynchronous slowing with brief epochs which can be seen in
a sleep-deprived individual or an individual who is drifting off to sleep and then is stimulated.

MEDICATIONS: Metformin, Aspirin, Simvastatin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed. This is a
postictal recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. The patient is drowsy with an increase in theta noted.
The background EEG demonstrates frequent bursts of frontally predominantly 3-5 Hz spike and wave activity. There is some head rocking artifact, but the spike and wave activity is typically high amplitude, frontally predominantly with bursts lasting less than 2 seconds, and ranges from 3 to 3.5 Hz.
The patient is falling asleep with photic stimulation. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response at faster flash frequencies. There is also some spike and wave activity noted In photic, which is somewhat slower, more compatible with a drowsy pattern than a photic paroxysmal response. Other features to suggest that the patient is falling asleep In photic stimulation include vertex waves and spindles.
HR: 84 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Frontally predominant 3-5 Hz spike and wave activity.
2. Some polyspike and wave activity.
3. Mild background slowing compatible with postictal state.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is most consistent with an inheritance mechanism for seizures. Because there is a small degree of background slowing in this still postictal adult, a follow up study In the lab may be of value.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with1 channel of EKG. The patient appears drowsy and is not able to cooperate with hyperventilation or photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, there is an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm. There is a small amount of theta. The patient drifts off into sleep and a lower voltage slow pattern is noted. In the transition out of sleep, there are bursts of beta activity in the central regions which are relatively symmetric but there are also some
bursts of 8 Hz activity in the left frontotemporal region. This activity is seen as the patient transitions towards stage 2 sleep with abundant vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS. The patient transitions in and out of stage 2 sleep. Photic stimulation does arouse the patient but does not produce a driving response.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the background rhythm was slow in theta and delta frequencies.  There was an asymmetry of activity in parasagittal and temporal region with activity being of faster frequency with higher voltage on the left cerebral hemisphere most pronounced in T5/T3 with polymorphic theta and delta sharply contoured discharges.  There was breach rhythm seen at the left mid and posterior temporal and left central region.  There were occasional sharp wave discharges in frontotemporal region with no evolution.  Drowsiness was characterized by further slowing of the background and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies with no abnormal responses.  Heart rate was 90 to 100 beats per minute with occasional PVCs.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG recording due to:
No posterior dominant rhythm.
Generalized slowing of the background activity in theta and delta range.
Polymorphic theta and delta activity at the left frontotemporal and central region.
Occasional sharp waves seen arising from the left frontotemporal region.
Left breach rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Diffuse slowing of the background activity during wakefulness could be due to toxic, metabolic, or infectious encephalopathy, effect of sedating medication or bilateral cerebral dysfunction.  Breach rhythm is consistent with the patient's history of craniotomy.  Almost continuous polymorphic theta and delta activity seen at the left temporal region suggesting of an underlying structural abnormality in the subcortical white matter of the left hemisphere.  The sharp waves seen arising from the left frontotemporal region are suggestive of epileptogenicity in the left cerebral cortex.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record, while there is some eye artifact picked up in the T1 and T2 electrodes, there is also some sharply contoured slowing observed. There appear to be some sharp waves noted in the record which do not correlate with the patient's eye movement artifact. These are maximum at T1. This burst of activity is seen most prominently just at the end of hyperventilation with sharply contoured slowing. Later on in the record, just at the end of the hyperventilation with the patient drifting off to sleep, a little bit more clearly defined left temporal sharply contoured slowing is again seen with some isolated bursts. Features of drowsiness include an increase in background theta. During photic stimulation there is a bilateral driving, but again a handful of these sharply contoured bursts are noted.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Left rhythmic temporal focal slowing.
2. Sharp waves.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: In wakefulness, the awake background includes a low-voltage beta pattern. Features of drowsiness include rhythmic central theta followed by vertex waves. There are a handful of vertex waves which demonstrate shifting asymmetries.
Hyperventilation produces a small increase in amplitude of the background. Photic stimulation is performed as the patient is drifting off to sleep and does not significantly activate the record. Minor shifting asymmetries are noted in the background, particularly at the close of the record and a bit more remarkable in the right central region.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Excess beta.
2. Excess theta.

stimulation are performed. The patient is comfortable, but relatively somnolent.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is abnormal and relatively
slow. There is a lower voltage in the theta and delta pattern on the right. In contrast, the
left has less faster frequency activity. Stimulation of the patient produces some faster
alpha and beta frequency activity on the right, but less so on the left. The patient is
restless. Shifting arrhythmic delta activity is observed. A critical team was called to
administer medications which do slow the heart rate, but this intervention does not
change the EEG. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is drowsy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is low voltage, relatively
slow. Superimposed upon this is an asymmetry with a bit higher amplitude activity from
the left compared to the right. In wakefulness there is a bit more sharply contoured
slowing noted from the left. There are some subtle sharp waves at T3. As the patient
becomes drowsy, however, the asymmetry is less prominent and in drowsiness there is
more of a slow lower voltage delta pattern. A handful of these subtle left temporal sharp
waves are maximum at C3 rather than T3. Photic stimulation is performed while the
patient is relatively drowsy and does not activate the record.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is awake, but confused.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal and includes a continuous, high amplitude periodic complex in the right posterior quadrant at
Ts/01. In some locations it seems to be maximum at 01 and other at T5. This high amplitude discharge has some volume conduction to the contralateral occipital region. The amplitude of the activity exceeds 250 microvolts. It has the characteristic of PEDS PLUS. In addition, in some points it is essentially a left hemispheric spike and slow wave complex. No clinical seizures are noted during the record, but at one point the activity starts to transition to more of a rhythmic theta-delta. Photic stimulation does not activate the record. At the close of the record, despite the high amplitude periodic complex in the right occipital region, the patient is conversant.
HR: 107bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Essentially continuous periodic complex from the left occipital parietal region.
2. Potentially a subclinical seizure when the continuous sharp waves transition to more of a rhythmic theta-delta pattern.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is a relatively rhythmic slow theta pattern with frequent eye blink. When the patient is resting comfortably, there is primarily rhythmic frontal theta activity. Frontal delta is noted bilaterally, which is higher amplitude on the left than the right, and there is a notched or suspicious left frontal sharp wave. With stimulation, there is the suggestion of an underlying 9 Hz alpha rhythm on the left, not apparent on the right. The bursts of delta are a bit more prominent on the left compared to the right.
HR: 68 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Rhythmic background slowing.
2. Asymmetric alpha rhythm, better identified on the left.
3. A handful of sharp waves in the frontal regions and one in the left mid-temporal region.

MEDICATIONS: None
INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient keeps a log. He is able to push the button for all of the events that he experiences. He has multiple episodes of dizziness or disorienting feeling.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10 hertz posterior dominant rhythm which is symmetrically reactive. Drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic background theta with vertex waves, spindles and stage II sleep. There is an epoch in which REM sleep is seen.
In the interictal EEG, there is a single left temporal sharp wave.
Events: The patient has multiple dizzy spells including 1:29, 1:25, 3:12, 3:36, 5:36, 5:46 and then there are no additional push buttons noted.
Although not all of the seizures have a clear clinical correlate and some have only either subtle theta or subtle disruption of faster frequency activity in the left temporal region, some have clear, rhythmic 4 hertz theta from the left temporal region with some spread to the frontocentral region bilaterally, typically lasting 20-40 seconds. The patient receives Depakote at 2:20 p.m., the discharges are briefer, more evanescent more allusive.
Event time 12930: the patient has a dizzy spell characterized by decreased alpha frequency activity from the left temporal region and a brief burst of left temporal theta.
Event time: 2:32 p.m.: There is a brief burst of left temporal theta which differs from the background.
Event time: 3:12p.m.: Aura of dizziness, left temporal theta.
Event #3: Aura characterized by dizziness time 335 to 33729, rhythmic temporal theta as described above.
Event #4: Subtle left temporal theta at 3:53:52.
Event #5: 536, very subtle left temporal theta.
Event #6: Aura 5:46:13, brief burst of left temporal theta.
HR: 100 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG monitoring due to:
1. Subtle, intermittent attenuation of alpha frequency activity in the left temporal region.
2. A handful of well defined auras characterized by rhythmic 4 hertz theta with clear frequency evolution. The characteristic seizure pattern for this patient includes attenuation of alpha in the region, then the theta and then some bilateral frontocentral spread.
3. Rare interictal findings including sharp waves in the left temporal region and sharply contoured theta. An example of this is at 4:35:37 a.m. on the morning of the second.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is diagnostic of a localization related mechanism for epilepsy. These findings were reviewed with the patient during the hospitalization.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This is an almost exclusively sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG includes a stage I and stage II sleep with frequent transitions between stage I and stage II. There are vertex wave, K-complexes, spindles and POSTS.  Some of the vertex waves are somewhat asymmetric. While most are maximum at CZ, they have a more generous field of spread and the diphasic wave is significantly higher amplitude and more prolonged on the left compared to the right. The composition of the wave forms, however, is quite similar with a 0.97 hertz after going slow wave. Brief wakefulness includes a 9.5 hertz alpha rhythm.

887,"CLINICAL HISTORY: 62 year old right handed with encephalopathy, myoclonus, status post tracheostomy.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Fentanyl, ASA, Keppra
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates very low voltage featureless pattern. There are vertex waves but there seem to be a handful of very low voltage vertex spikes noted in the sections of the record with less in the way of muscle and movement artifact. There is also some low voltage rhythmic theta activity which occurs in bursts, again a little more prominent at the midline. There is some occasional twitching which produces some artifact.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Relatively low voltage featureless pattern.
2. Very low voltage vertex spikes.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Some of the same vertex epileptiform activity was seen in the previous activity. There is far less in the way of myoclonus and the activity identified now is not assessed. The endo myoclonic jerks identified in the record are so subtle and are difficult to seen on the video and are not associated with epileptiform features. Overall, this EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.

stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well
organized. There is a 9 Hz, 40 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm identified. It is
initially subtly asymmetric. Hyperventilation is performed in the record and
hyperventilation elicits rhythmic left temporal slowing. As hyperventilation concludes the
patient is somewhat drowsy and again this rhythmic, left temporal4 Hz activity is
identified, which sometimes again disrupts the posterior dominant rhythm. Photic
stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR: 96 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Rhythmic left temporal 4 Hz activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: While there are no epileptiform features observed in this
record, the rhythmic slowing described above is relatively characteristic of that seen in

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  The overall background in maximal wakefulness is appropriate for a subject of this age.  There are occasional bursts of shifting slowing with isolated delta in right or left hemisphere noted early in drowsiness. Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained. Hyperventilation elicits shifting delta from the right or left hemisphere.   Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is slow and disorganized. It is primarily a theta delta pattern with a glimpse of a 9 hertz alpha rhythm on the right. There seems to be a breech rhythm with higher amplitude activity on the left compared to the right. Sharp waves are identified most of which have a T1 phase reversal, but there are a handful of sharp waves which start at T2, lower voltage and then higher amplitude, left anterior temporal T2-F7. The sharp waves seem to be accentuated by hyperventilation. The focal slowing on the left is also accentuated by hyperventilation. Although there is no mention of a previous craniotomy, there is higher amplitude activity on the left and as the patient becomes drowsy, there is a bit more focal left frontal temporal delta. Photic stimulation produces scant driving more apparent on the right than the left.
HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Focal slowing on the left compared to the right.
3. Sharp waves seem primarily from the left, but some of which start on the right and end on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a focal process on the left involving gray and white matter. In addition, the overall background is slow suggesting a bihemispheric process. Correlation with imaging is appropriate, but overall, this EEG supports a focal mechanism for seizures.

MEDICATIONS: Depakote, Hydralazine, Amlodipine
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is somewhat confused.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Although the patient is able to answer questions, the background EEG is markedly abnormal. The left hemisphere is somewhat lower voltage. The right hemisphere includes a rhythmic delta activity with a high amplitude spike and slow wave complex in the right frontocentral region with some variability typically C4.
When the patient is asked to count to 10, 8 Hz activity appears out of the right hemisphere. At one point, the pattern almost looks like an alerting but at another point during this, it almost looks as if an ictal pattern is generated during this testing. There is variability in the record with some sections demonstrating more alpha frequency activity than others. The right hemisphere demonstrates a significant breech rhythm.
The spike and wave activity has a slower periodicity demonstrating some waxing and waning but its alpha theta frequency activity which may represent an ictal pattern for this individual versus an arousal. Photic stimulation does not clearly activate the record.
HR: 84 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Prominent epileptiform activity in the right central region.
2. Questionable subclinical seizures characterized by more rhythmic delta theta from the right and/or perhaps a pattern of more rhythmic alpha theta frequency activity.
3. Relatively lower voltage featureless pattern on the right.
4. Breech rhythm with much higher amplitude activity on the right
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a structural process on the right involving gray and white matter. There is a highly epileptogenic focus on the right. Additional recording is suggested to make sure that clinical seizures are not missed.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 11-Hz alpha rhythm. Drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic background theta followed by vertex waves. The patient seems to be somewhat drowsy, transitioning in between wakefulness and stage I sleep. Hyperventilation produces a vigorous hyperventilation response with rhythmic theta. After this, the patient transitions to stage II sleep with vertex waves, Kcomplexes, spindles, and posts. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is drifting off to sleep but does not significantly activate the record.
HR: 55 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage II sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features were observed in this EEG. A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of panic or epilepsy.

INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta and theta.  There is a slight asymmetry as the patient gets drowsy with a slight dropout of faster frequency activity in the left hemisphere before the right and a single T1 discreet sharp wave.
Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.

Intermittent left hemispheric sharp waves are captured.  Phase reversal occurs over F7, T1, T3 and Fp1, F3 electrodes.  There is nearly continuous EMG artifact that effects variable leads.  Premature QRS complexes are captured on a single EKG lead.
FINDINGS:
Mild diffuse slowing.
Mild to moderate right hemispheric slowing.
Intermittent sharp waves over the left frontal/anterior temporal region.
Occasional premature QRS complexes seen on EKG.
EMG artifact that is nearly continuous effecting variable leads throughout the recording.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal awake only 23 minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing, mild to moderate right hemispheric slowing, as well as intermittent left frontal/anterior temporal epileptiform discharges.  Diffuse slowing indicates etiologically nonspecific diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Focal right hemispheric slowing indicates focal cerebral dysfunction, likely structural in etiology, and is consistent with the patient's history of right MCA territory stroke.  There is an epileptogenic focus over the left frontal/anterior temporal region.  A large amount of EMG artifact is present throughout the recording, so subtle abnormalities might have been missed.  No clear electrographic seizures are captured.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Much of the record includes relaxed wakefulness or drowsiness. In this drowsy state there is more of a theta and beta frequency pattern. In addition, there are bursts of sharply contoured focal slowing in the left anterior temporal region. Some of the bursts occur with pairs or brief bursts of sharply contoured theta frequency activity. Photic stimulation produces scant driving, as well as some electrode artifact. The left anterior temporal, irregular, sharply contoured slowing is identified at that time as well. There appears to be a T1/T3 sharp wave mixed with this. As the patient becomes a bit more drowsy, there is also some rhythmic theta in the left frontal region. The normal testing to search for an alpha rhythm was not performed. Spontaneous eye opening and eye closure was identified, but there appeared to be scant, lower voltage, 10.5 Hz alpha activity, better defined on the right compared to the left.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal. The overall
background is a mixture of irregular theta and delta. There are posteriorly predominant sharp
waves, includes P5, and independently T6 02. There are bursts of faster frequency activity
which are picked up at the midline. The activity from the left frontal region is more or less
suppressed and there is more arrhythmic delta activity noted on the right. Tactile stimulation of
the patient seems to elicit a run of epileptiform activity. The epileptiform activity from the right
and left do not seem to be connected, but tactile stimulation seems to have produced
asynchronous train of sharp waves and spikes from either hemisphere, each of which have its
own periodicity. Additional spontaneous bursts of this epileptiform activity are noted. Again,
right occipital temporal and left occipital, again, without clear linkage between the 2 bursts.
96bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Relative suppression of activity from the frontal regions.
2. Occipitally temporal predominant epileptiform activity.
3. Marked background slowing and disorganization.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a highly epileptogenic process. The
epileptiform activity is generous posteriorly, not anteriorly. These findings may be
correlated with this patient's clinical exam and history. The possibility of subclinical seizures
should be considered in this individual.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  There is no mention of a scar on the brain or craniotomy in the tech information.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is appropriately organized for age.  There is an 11 Hz, 40 mcv posterior dominant rhythm, and a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements.  This is followed by frontocentral theta.  Occasional posterior slow waves of youth are noted.  There is a single slightly asynchronous vertex wave noted in sleep and there is a bit more head rocking artifact on the right.  Vertex waves and POSTs are rare in the sleep record.

HISTORY:  A 69-year-old woman with history of seizures on Dilantin eager to stop medications.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness and stage 1 and stage 2 sleep.  Activating procedure included photic stimulation performed which revealed no abnormal discharges.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins, there is a 7.5 Hz alpha
rhythm identified more so on the right than the left. There is an asymmetry with more of
a suppressed pattern on the left compared to the right but this waxes and wanes. In the
overnight sleep section of the record, there are some occasional sharp waves noted on
the left. There are also some bilateral bifrontal sharp waves noted in sleep with almost
a metabolic appearance.
As the recording continues, there are more triphasic wave forms observed in the
overnight sleep record, but by 5 a.m. these seem to have resolved. On the morning of
the 8th, the background EEG is quite well organized but occasional left frontal sharp
waves are noted.
In addition, again intermittently, there are both bursts of bifrontal sharp waves, triphasic
waves. and left temporal sharp waves. These do not appear to be associated with a
change in the patient's clinical status. These bursts are not associated with defined
clinical changes in the patient.
By 1:55, the EEG is now better organized. At 2:11, the bifrontal sharp waves appear.
They appear in paroxysmal bursts with a background slowing almost as if it is a
metabolic pattern.
There is no baseline for this long-term EEG monitoring session.
HR: 70 to 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing.
2. Focal slowing from the left temporal region which seems to be improving over time.
3. Triphasic waves.
4. Bursts of bifrontal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG suggests more than one process. The first is a
postoperative process which gets better over time in terms of focal slowing. Sharp
waves on the left are anticipated following craniotomy. The paroxysmal bursts both
triphasic waves and bilateral sharp waves may be a metabolic phenomenon or part of
her underlying dementia.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  The patient is restless and moving about.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a remarkable and fluctuating asymmetry.  Some sections of the record demonstrate attenuation of faster frequency activity on the right with the exception of bursts of beta more prominent on the right.  Other sections of the record demonstrate much more significant underlying arrhythmic delta activity underneath the alpha-frequency activity in the left hemisphere.  A 9 Hz alpha rhythm can be identified from either hemisphere, sometimes symmetrically, sometimes asymmetrically.  There is also some sharply contoured slowing and a handful of T1, T3 sharp waves on the left.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta, particularly on the right.
HR:    72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  This is an interesting and abnormal EEG due to:
Fluctuating asymmetries with at times more underlying arrhythmic delta on the left or right.
Asymmetries on the right, some of which would suggest a cortical process on the right such as disruption of faster frequency activity with disruption of the alpha frequency, but an increase in beta would contradict this.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient is tremulous throughout the EEG with rhythmic
3╖4 hertz activity. In the brief sections were the patient's jitteriness resolves, the overall
background is one of beta and 2╖3 hertz delta. Review of the video demonstrates not so much
movement, but he does have titubation of the head and that likely accentuates the amount of
EEG artifact. In addition, during the a section of the record where the patient Is not moving, he
has a section with higher amplitude left central sharp waves. There is also another section with
a great deal of artifact and asymmetry with more rhythmic almost vertex like waves on the right
rather than the left. This was an extremely technically challenging study.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness there seems to be a bilateral alpha rhythm.  There is a great deal of muscle artifact noted at maximal wakefulness.  As the patient relaxes, the background demonstrates slowing and more clear slowing is noted in the right hemisphere.  As he becomes sleepier there is a focus of delta in the right posterior region.  With the use of an average reference, a slow, periodic sharp complex can be identified at PZ and in the right parietal occipital region.  With arousal, this becomes less prominent.

INTRODUCTION:  A digital EEG was performed in the lab using the standard International 10-20 system of electrode placement in addition to one channel of EKG monitoring.  Hyperventilation was not performed and photic stimulation was performed.  This tracing captures wakefulness and stage I and II sleep.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, alpha rhythm is 8-8.5 Hz in frequency, 30-50 microvolts in amplitude seen in occipital region which attenuates with eye opening.  There is 6-7 Hz diffuse theta activity seen during wakefulness which is distributed symmetrically.  There was a small amount of low amplitude frontocentral beta activity which is distributed symmetrically.  A stage I and stage II sleep is characterized with disappearance of alpha rhythm, slowing of the background activity, and absence of motion and eye-blink artifact as well as presence of the vertex sharp waves, sleep spindles, and K complexes.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple frequencies and did not resolve in a driving response.  Heart rate was 60-70 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is mildly abnormal EEG due to excess theta activity during wakefulness.  There was no epileptiform discharge or seizure activity noted during this recording.  The above finding could be due to metabolic, toxic, hypoxic, or infectious encephalopathy.  Alternatively, it could be due to effect of sedating medication, bilateral cerebral dysfunction, degenerative brain disease.  No epileptiform abnormalities or seizures were captured or recorded.  This does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy or intermittent seizures.

REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video long-term EEG for 18 hours was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional EKG and anterior temporal electrodes.  The patient was comatose and unresponsive during the EEG.  No activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffuse background which is disorganized, mainly in the delta/theta frequencies with no normal posterior dominant rhythm and no normal frontocentral beta.  No normal sleep architecture is also seen.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges seen at T4-T6 at a frequency of 2 Hz with amplitude of 20 to 75 microvolts.  These discharges are seen continuously but appear to evolve as described in the seizure paragraph.  During the recording, these PLEDs become more blunted and less frequent, but they are continuously seen.  At times during the last part of the recording, they appeared to have more anterior predominance, moving from T4 forward to the F8 region.
Diffuse slow waves seen in the recording.
SEIZURES:   Frequent seizures are seen emanating from the T6-T4 electrode which evolve from PLEDs and stop.  There is a contralateral left hemisphere artifact as well as in the video left arm trembling can be seen during these seizures.  There are multiple of these occurring at the beginning of the recording, almost continuously. However, as the over time the recording improves, the periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges become more blunted and the seizures stop.  During the rest of the EEG, the last 10 hours of the EEG, there is only intermittent muscle artifact on the left hemisphere but no clear actual seizures being seen.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Frequent seizures arising from the left posterotemporal region, which later improve, and none seen during the last 10 hours.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with the diagnosis of localization epilepsy arising from the right posterotemporal region, with multiple seizures seen from that region.  Please note that the seizures improve and none are seen during the last 10 hours. In addition there is continuous evidence of acute focal dysfunction and irritability in the right hemisphere.  Lastly, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction which in this patient is likely due, at least in part, to medication affect.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a very low voltage pattern. However, there is central vertex waves and central beta activity. The remainder of the EEG is relatively low voltage and featureless. Out of this quite suppressed background, there is a spontaneous arousal with eye opening and the appearance of brief 8 Hz alpha frequency activity and theta.
HR: 120 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 1. Replacement of normal background with a low voltage slow pattern. 2. Intermittent attenuation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In that there is a spontaneous arousal with just a somewhat slow pattern, this EEG may represent a toxic, metabolic, or other transient phenomenon. There were no epileptiform feature and no focal features. No ominous prognostic features were noted.

INTRODUCTION:  Long term digital video EEG was performed for 14 hours using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with a 1 channel EKG and anterior temporal electrodes.  The study was recorded while the patient was comatose.  No activity procedures were performed.  Continuous EEG monitoring was performed and reviewed using spike detection and seizure detection software as well as nursing noted events.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a low amplitude diffusely slow background with frequencies mainly in the delta range.  No normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta is seen.  No sleep architecture is seen.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Generalized periodic epileptiform discharges (GPEDs) were seen with anterior central maximum at a frequency of 1-2 Hz.  At times this would evolve, see description of seizures below.
Generalized slow waves seen at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-40 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  There are multiple seizures occurring per hour seen at the beginning of the recording which originate from GPEDs which increase in frequency and amplitude in seconds and later are obscured by a rhythmic intermittent muscle artifact.  The longest of these last about 40 seconds and afterwards  the background returns to baseline.  These seizures appear to subside 4 hours into the recording and after 10:30 at night no more are seen.  After this time the GPEDs appear to become slightly blunted and lower in amplitude, although at times intermittently the morphology changes to more sharply contoured but never clearly evolve into seizures.  Later in the recording in the morning hours there is some intermittent diffuse muscle artifact but no underlying evolution of seizures or epileptiform activity could be clearly seen in between the bursts of muscle.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized seizures.
Diffuse slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals multiple seizures with a generalized onset and interictal evidence of diffuse brain dysfunction and irritability.  These findings are consistent with a diffuse cortical injury and with a history of hypoxic injury.  The EEG appears to improve with time and during the last 10 hours of the recording no seizures can be clearly seen.

MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Fentanyl, Ativan.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is comatose, unresponsive, with intermittent eye blinking.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal and includes multiple electrographic seizures which are clinically associated with eye blink.  Much of the EEG is, in fact, ictal with seizures seeming to wax and wane.  It is difficult at this point to determine when seizures begin and end, but the very first seizure for this patient seems to begin with a burst of rhythmic higher amplitude sharply contoured activity on the left.  Many of the seizures are characterized by high amplitude rhythmic theta-delta or spike-and-wave activity which is essentially bilateral.  Some seizures end with T6 spiking.  Others end with rhythmic sharply contoured activity on the left.  As the recording continues, the seizures begin with faster frequency activity alpha and beta out of the frontal regions and then a paroxysmal evolution.  Some of the seizures do have a clearly defined ending with a slow background and then the T6 periodic sharp waves.  There are sections of the record where there is a T6 sharp wave and a T1 burst of sharply contoured delta.
As the recording continues, more of the epileptiform activity is in the right hemisphere and may be posterotemporal or anterior temporal.
By 12:34, the nurse is providing Ativan.  As the record ends at 12:40, epileptiform activity is noted and has not resolved.
HR:    120 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
Multiple electrographic seizures which seem to emanate from the frontal regions but at least in some locations either begin or end with epileptiform activity in the left frontal or even right posterotemporal region.
Interictal epileptiform activity from multiple different localizations including T1, T3, T4, and T6.
Background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is diagnostic of a complex partial status epilepticus.  Based on these findings, continuous video EEG monitoring was initiated.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 6 Hz.  There is no normal sleep architecture seen.  No activating procedures.  However, during the EEG the patient is stimulated and there appears to be a response and reactivity to the EEG with increased muscle artifact and some slight increase in the frequencies.  No normal frontocentral beta is seen.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal sharp waves seen at C4/F4 frequently throughout the recording.
Focal slow wave seen at F4/C4 throughout the recording.  Please note that at times the sharp waves and slowing becomes slightly more monomorphic and rhythmic, however, it does not appear to evolve clearly in pattern, therefore not consistent with a clear electrographic seizure.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due:
Focal sharp and slow waves arising from the right frontocentral region.
Generalized slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with the diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with seizures arising rightly from the right frontocentral region.  In addition, there is evidence of focal structural cerebral dysfunction in this region which has a direct correlation with a lesion in that region.  Lastly, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology, but may be due at least in part to medication effect.  No seizures were clearly seen.

MEDICATIONS:  Albuterol.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a symmetric reactive 9 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. In relaxed wakefulness, there are bursts of frontally predominant 3-5 Hz spike and wave activity. Most bursts are under a second and all discharges are under 2 seconds in relaxed wakefulness. Hyperventilation clearly accentuates the frontally predominant spike and wave and poly spike and wave activity. The major of discharges are symmetric in the frontocentral region. Hyperventilation also produces an increase in burst duration with some bursts waxing and waning, but lasting up to 6 seconds in duration. In addition, there are more clearly developed frontally predominant spike and wave and even polyspike and wave complexes noted following hyperventilation.
The technologist tests the patient and does not identify clinical correlates with these bursts. There are a handful of eye movements sometimes seen around the bursts, but no definitive focal features. As the patient transitions in and out of drowsiness, the frontally predominant spike and wave discharges become higher amplitude. Sleep is not sustained. Photic stimulation also does seem to accentuate the discharges, but there are no discharges that outlast the photic stimulation.
HR:    60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Frontally predominant spike and wave complexes of 3.5 to 5 Hz.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This is an awake and sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is an 8.3 Hz alpha rhythm.  There is a small amount of shifting slowing and there is occasional left frontal focal slowing with isolated theta or delta waves. Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing.  On rare occasions there are very brief bursts of bilateral attenuation as the patient drifts off to sleep.
HR:    60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Mild degree of background slowing and disorganization.
Shifting slowing with a little bit more shifting slowing identified in the left frontal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is more supportive of a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.  The focal features described above are quite subtle in view of this patient's history.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Decadron, Dilaudid.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Concern for seizures and change in mental status
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while lethargic.  No activating procedures were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a symmetric amplitude of frequencies which are increased over the right hemisphere, maximum in the temporal lobe.  Despite stimulation, there is only mild increase in the faster frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen continuously at T4/T6 at 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-100 microvolts.  This pattern is seen continuously throughout the recording and at times becomes more monomorphic and almost rhythmic, but does not clearly evolve.  It also at times has a more contoured pattern.  This pattern has an associated breach rhythm to it.
Generalized slow waves as described at 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts seen diffusely with intermittent periods of more suppressed activity.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due:
1.  Continuous mid to posterior temporal slowing in the setting of a breach.
2.  Marked generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the right mid to posterior temporal region, which is consistent with a known surgery and tumor removal.  In addition, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology and may be due to at least in part medication effect, bilateral white matter disease, or toxic metabolic encephalopathy.  No clear seizures were seen.  It would helpful if the patient continues to not improve to have a repeated EEG to reevaluate this intermittent rhythmic pattern in the right temporal lobe, especially is seizures remains a consideration.

MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Tegretol.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal.  There are brief sections of the record where it is reasonably well organized with a 6.8 Hz alpha rhythm of 30 mV and a theta frequency background.  More commonly, there is frontally predominant mixed theta delta.  High amplitude or medium amplitude spike and slow wave and sharp and slow wave complexes are observed with many different localizations.  The majority of these are frontal, particularly FP2, but some are FP1, others F8, F7.  Some have a more temporal spread and others are maximum in the central or central parietal regions independently on the right or the left.  The epileptiform activity is focal, but is occasional bifrontal and generalized.
Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background slowing.  The epileptiform activity may occur in pairs, but the two pairs are not always identical epileptiform discharges, although they are usually similar in terms of both occurring on the same hemisphere.  There may be a bit more focal slowing on the right as the patient transitions to sleep. Photic stimulation is remarkable for frequent epileptiform discharges with frontal delta, some of which almost has a spike and wave component on the left, but given the abundance of epileptiform activity, it is not clear that photic stimulation activated the record.
HR:    72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Multifocal epileptiform activity with prominent activity in the right frontal region.
Spike and wave activity seen with photic stimulation, perhaps more on the left.
Background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG suggests an irritative process with epileptiform activity occurring from many different loci.  No seizures were recorded.

ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and asleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizure or epileptiform discharges were seen.  The increased amount of frontocentral beta may be due to benzodiazepines the patient is taking.

MEDICATIONS:  Topamax, Creon, cyclobenzaprine, Benadryl, lamotrigine, metoprolol, ondansetron, oxycodone, Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab  using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 8 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of background theta.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in slowing, particularly in the central regions and disappearance of the alpha rhythm.  Sleep is not sustained.  Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.  Hyperventilation did not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate 66 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  A mildly abnormal EEG for an adult of this age in wakeful and limited drowsiness due to:
Mild excess theta.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9.7 Hz alpha rhythm which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in rhythmicity of the background as well as anterior spread of the alpha rhythm.  A single burst of paroxysmal rhythmic slowing is noted if the patient transitions to sleep but then photic stimulation is performed. The rare bursts of hypersynchronous slowing are noted in photic stimulation, but unfortunately this does seem to collide with the attempt to capture sleep.
HR:    72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Hypnagogic hypersynchrony is a normal variant.  If additional information is needed, a 1-hour study which does not need to be sleep

MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.   Hyperventilation was not performed due to the sinus problems, but photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat disorganized, but there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  There is slight shifting asymmetries noted in the alpha rhythm and it is a little faster on the left than the right.  There is also a lit bit of slowing noted at some points when the alpha rhythm is identified and that slowing is on the right.  Arrhythmic delta is noted in the left hemisphere, particularly central temporal region.  There is a suggestion of a breech rhythm with both a beta accentuation noted at some points and some underlying sharp waves.  Unfortunately, artifacts are also noted in the same region.
Brief drowsiness includes vertex waves with transitions in and out of sleep.  Snore artifact is observed.  Photic stimulation elicits a driving response better identified on the right than the left.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no clear posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.  When the patient is stimulated during the recording, there is no clear change in the wave forms.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal sharp waves seen at F4, continuously at a frequency of 0.5 to 1 Hz, representing periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs).  It is apparent that with each of these discharges, although not always consistently, there seems to be clinical correlates in the middle of left shoulder twitching.
Generalized slow waves at 2 to 4 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 70 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  Based on the description above, it is likely that the accompaniment of the PLEDs at F4 with the left shoulder twitching is consistent with focal motor seizures.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Right frontal PLEDs and focal motor seizures.
Generalized slow waves with intermittent periods of attenuation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals focal motor seizures arising from the right frontal region.  In addition, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regard to etiology but may be partly due to medication effect or cortical injury from the subarachnoid hemorrhage.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This patient had a clinical seizure during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The best organized EEG is at the end of the record with a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm in a symmetric background.
In the beginning of the EEG, there is a subtle asymmetry.  There seems to be a disruption of faster frequency activity in the right frontal region.  In addition, there is some sharply contoured activity in the left frontocentral region.  In this somewhat sharply contoured background, there seems to be a very subtle underlying sharp wave which can be seen at T3/T5 and C3.
A 10-second seizure is characterized by inability of the patient to respond.  That event occurs at 11:39:11.  It seems to begin with a burst of high amplitude 6.5 Hz activity which transitions to 3 Hz activity over 10 seconds.  Severe high amplitude discharge, but there seems to be a frontally predominant spike and wave discharge and interestingly, the focal features noted earlier on in the record disappear. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was unresponsive during the recording.  No activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some sweat artifact and movement artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record has a diffusely slow background in between the bursts that I will describe in the next paragraph.  She has a markedly suppressed background with no clear electrocerebral activity.  However, this is in between much artifact which makes it difficult to make any clear final determinations about electrical activity.  In addition, she has bursts of generalized periodic epileptiform discharges with frontal predominant sharp waves and polyspikes that appear to at times increase in rhythmicity to a frequency of about 4-5 Hz and last for about 30-40 seconds.  During these bursts, which are usually symmetric, but at times slightly asymmetric, the patient appears to be clinically shaking and twitching and jerking.  These are consistent with myoclonic jerks.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  As above.
SEIZURES:  Multiple myoclonic seizures as described above.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Frequent myoclonic seizures of prolonged duration in between markedly abnormal suppressed background.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cortical injury and irritability with multiple bursts of generalized periodic discharges and associated jerks consistent with myoclonic seizures.  The interictal pattern as well as the presence of myoclonus in the setting of hypoxic injury suggests a very poor prognosis.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm.  The alpha rhythm tends to be slightly asymmetric, little faster on the right than the left, ranging from 8.3 to 8.7.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in theta.  The record is slightly slower on the left posterior region than the right as the patient drifts off to sleep.  Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the record, although the slight asymmetry in the alpha rhythm was noted.
HR:    60 bpm, somewhat irregular.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
An asymmetry in the alpha rhythm with a somewhat slower pattern on the left.
Occasional, subtle underlying slowing on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In comparison to a previous EEG performed on November 9, 2011 that EEG demonstrated a more focal driving response on the left at 6 Hz compared to the right which was a nonspecific finding.  This EEG does not demonstrate that phenomenon a little slowing on the left.   These findings may reflect the patient's underlying cerebrovascular disease with a past history of silent cerebellar infarct picked up on imaging.

MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, Keppra,Thiamine
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizure.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while lethargic.  No activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow disorganized background with no posterior dominant rhythm or frontal central beta.  The patient has no normal sleep architecture.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal sharp waves seen with a white field, but maximal at T4 with a frequency of 1-3 Hz at an amplitude of 20-60 mV almost continuously throughout the recording with no clear evolution and some intermittent periods of pause for 2 seconds.  These are consistent with periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLED'S).
Focal slow waves at P4 in the right hemisphere maximal at P4 with a frequency of 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-60 mV.
Generalized slowing at 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-40 mV.  Note:  The low amplitude seen diffusely and intermixed with this generalized slowing there is some bursts of 14-15 Hz discharges with a spindle appearance seen diffusely.
SEIZURES:  None seen.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Right hemispheric maximal parietal PLED'S and slow waves.
Generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of right hemispheric maximal parietal focal structural dysfunction and irritability, which is consistent with a known lesion seen on the CT.  In addition, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  However, the spindle like discharges suggest it may be, at least in part, due to medication effect.  No seizures were seen during this routine recording.  If there is further concern for intermittent seizures, I would recommend continuous monitoring to evaluate for this occurrence.

ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
EVENTS:  During photic stimulation, the patient started having slow movements of her head side to side then started twitching her upper extremities and moving her body towards the right side and appeared to be unresponsive to commands.  This episode lasted for a period of about 40 seconds and then she remained with her eyes closed and appeared to be slightly more responsive.  Minutes later, photic stimulation was performed again after she had opened her eyes and appeared to have followed commands.  At that point she started jerking her left shoulder slowly, then trembling her upper extremities and again falling towards the right side of the seat.  This second episode lasted for about approximately a minute and 20 seconds.  During both episodes, the EEG revealed a normal awake background with no epileptiform abnormalities and no EEG correlate to this behavior described above.

1361,"CLINICAL HISTORY:  49 year old right handed male with post traumatic epilepsy, closed head trauma injury in 1980, atonic seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Phenobarbital, Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This is the patient's fourth EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat slow and disorganized.  There is some bursts of posterior predominant slowing.  There are also bursts of frontally predominant high amplitude 3 Hz spike and slow wave activity.  This activity demonstrates some asymmetry, maybe a little bit more prominent in the right frontal region on the left.  It starts to transition to more of a 4-5 Hz spike and wave activity.
Although it is present in relaxed wakefulness, it also occurs during hyperventilation.  Most bursts are less than 2 seconds in duration.  No impairment of awareness is noted with the bursts.
As the patient becomes drowsy, following hyperventilation, the bursts are again seen, but are a little bit slower and transition to a more of an almost 3 second burst with a high amplitude frontal spike, followed by rhythmic delta, which may or may not have a spike.  All of the activity has bilateral representation, but some has a field more prominent on the right.
Photic stimulation may well have accentuated this activity and, again, in photic stimulation sometimes there did seem to be a more clearly defined right frontal spike and slow wave complex before the left, but not always.
At the end of the record when the patient is maximally awake, there is little in the way of background slowing.
Even when the EEG is well organized, the alpha rhythm remains low at 8 Hz.
HR:    64 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Frontally predominant 3-5 Hz spike and wave activity, which was accentuated by hyperventilation and photic.
Occasional shifting asymmetries, particularly in the posterior region.
A slow alpha for an adult of this age.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There are features in this EEG which support a focal mechanism for epilepsy.  Other features support a generalized mechanism, particularly with 3-5 Hz frontally predominant spike and wave activity, which was accentuated by hyperventilation and photic stimulation.  This suggests more than one possible contributor to this patient's epilepsy.
Of note, some of these findings were seen in an EEG in March 2011, but not in October 2010 or September 2011.

1363,"CLINICAL HISTORY: 35 year old man with hypertension, pericarditis, alcohol abuse, HIV, lupus who presents with seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Ativan, Protonix, Lovenox.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with an additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness only.  Activating procedures are not performed except minor photic stimulation was performed for a couple of seconds.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  The patient is recorded mainly during wakefulness.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
EPISODES:  During the recording, the patient had 2 episodes where at the beginning he would start stretching his arm and becoming tense then his body started trembling slowly in his hands and his feet and developing whole body trembling lasting for about 1 minute 15 seconds, not being able to follow commands during the episode and not recalling the code word.  Afterward, he woke up and asked what happened and he was crying.  During this first episode, there was no clear EEG abnormality or changes and after the event there was a clear posterior dominant rhythm that could be changed.  During the event, there were just multiple artifacts.  A second event occurred minutes later while photic stimulation was started.  He started trembling slowly and the whole body started shaking irregularly and moving toward the left side.  This episode lasted about 2 minutes and again afterward the patient remained unresponsive for some time.  During the entire episode, the EEG did not reveal any epileptiform activity or any EEG correlate.  There was a lot of muscle artifact and after the event there was a clear normal posterior dominant rhythm seen during the recording.  Two episodes of diffuse body shaking with no unresponsiveness and no EEG correlate.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:   The 2 episodes with diffuse body shaking had no EEG correlate which is consistent with the diagnosis of a nonepileptic event.  No seizures or epileptiform activity were seen during the recording.

MEDICATIONS:  Lovenox, Percocet,
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 8.7 Hz alpha rhythm of 40 mV.  There is a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta. Hyperventilation is performed early in the record producing an increase in theta, following this the patient becomes drowsy with attenuation of the alpha rhythm and an increase in both beta and theta.  Vertex waves are noted in stage I sleep.  Vertex waves are slightly asymmetric.
In stage I and stage II sleep frontal beta is quite prominent. Hyperventilation produces a small amount of theta.  The patient is drifting into and out of stage II sleep during photic stimulation, which does not otherwise activate the record.
HR:    60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is within normal limits in wakefulness through stage II sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  Asymmetry in the vertex waves could be related to a head measuring error, therefore, this should not be considered pathological.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient is intubated and unresponsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates a diffusely slow pattern.  It is a mixed frequency pattern with generous beta and theta.  There is intermittent attenuation of the background lasting about 1-2 seconds.  In addition, although there is some technical issues, the frontal regions sometimes demonstrate a bit more attenuation.  EEG is overall relatively symmetric. Stimulation of the patient produces an attenuation of the background.
HR:    96 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Replacement of normal background with a mixed frequency markedly slow pattern.
Intermittent attenuation of the background.
Flattening of the activity.  Flattening of the EEG in response to stimulation.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using a standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while unresponsive.  No activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontal central beta.  There is no normal sleep architecture.  No activating procedures were performed.  During the recording the patient is stimulated and there is no real change in the background.  I will describe the background and the abnormal discharges in the next paragraph.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  The EEG is fully comprised of a background predominated by bilateral frontal central predominant sharp waves, followed by slow waves in a periodic pattern at 2 Hz in a monomorphic rhythm that does not change, consistent with generalized periodic epileptiform discharges (GED's) occurring throughout the entirety of the recording.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during unresponsiveness and comatose.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely attenuated, or almost completely suppressed background, with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontal central beta.  There is no normal sleep architecture.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
During the recording there is intermittent bursts of anterior predominant spike and wave, as well as polyspike and wave appearing at 5 Hz in bursts that may last up to 20-30 seconds.  They appear to be mainly symmetric, but with some frontal predominance at times.  During these bursts the patient is seen on video to be having regular diffuse marked jerking of the truncal muscles associated with each one of these bursts.  This is most consistent with myoclonus.
Generalized attenuation of background.
SEIZURES:  See myoclonus described above.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
myoclonus and diffuse suppression of the EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cortical dysfunction and irritability, which is consistent with the known hypoxic injury.  However, it is possible that the intermixed diffuse attenuation may be at least in part due to medication effect.  Lastly, the myoclonus seen after a hypoxic injury suggests a poor prognosis for significant neurological recovery.

REASON FOR STUDY:  Myoclonic jerks.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while unresponsive and having jerks. No activating procedures were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely low attenuated background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or normal frontocentral beta.  Patient had no normal sleep architecture.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Throughout the recording, there are frequent frontally predominant and right more than left sharp waves which appeared to start and decrease in frequency for about 2-10 seconds with some minimal spread to the left hemisphere.  During these discharges, the patient appears to move and it is difficult to be clear of the precise locations of the discharges.  In between these discharges, there is diffuse attenuation and cortical suppression in the EEG.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Frequent bilateral frontally predominant discharges with some right-sided asymmetry.
Evidence of diffuse cortical attenuation in between the bursts.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cortical dysfunction and attenuation in addition to frequent myoclonic seizures which appears to have a bilateral frontal onset and lateral right-sided predominance.  It is possible that the known left cortical stroke is causing this asymmetric appearance.
The presence of these discharges after a posthypoxic event carries a poor prognosis.  The lower attenuation is likely due to diffuse cortical dysfunction, however, there may be some influence due to the sedation medications.

MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, Ativan, Hydralazine, Lorazepam
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This is a bedside EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm on the left.  The right hemisphere demonstrates significant disruption of faster frequency activity, particularly in the lateral temporal regions and central temporal regions.  Mu activity is identified on the left and at the midline, but not on the right.  As the recording continues there is variability of terms of the disruption of faster frequency activity on the right and in some sections the faster frequency is disrupted throughout the right hemisphere.  EKG artifact is prominent at T2.  This drowsy patient seems to have micro-sleeps with sleep spindles.
HR:    40-60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal due to:
Marked disruption of faster frequency activity in the right hemisphere.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is awake or asleep.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The activity on the right is reasonably well organized, particularly in the frontocentral region with a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  The left hemisphere demonstrates more significant arrhythmic delta activity and slowing of the alpha rhythm.  In addition, there is left frontal delta.  There is also a sharply contoured focus in the left parietal region.  As the patient drifts off to sleep, arrhythmic delta activity is much more prominent in the left hemisphere with some shifting slowing on the left.
HR:    60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
An interhemispheric asymmetry with a slow and disorganized pattern on the left.
Shifting slowing on the left, some of which is sharply contoured in the left parietal region.
Mildly slow background on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were recorded.  The left hemispheric focal slowing is consistent with a history of stroke.  The mild background slowing on the right is more supportive of a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.

REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while unresponsive. Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some movement artifact throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow EEG with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontal central beta.  There is no normal sleep architecture seen throughout the recording.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
The background of the EEG is consistent with anterior predominant symmetric 1-2 Hz anterior predominant triphasic waves seen almost continuously throughout the recording.
Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 microvolts seen continuously throughout the recording.  At times, the patient is stimulated and there is diffuse muscle artifact and a slight increase in the frequencies.
At times there are some frontally sharply contoured wave forms but not clearly epileptic.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slowing, anterior triphasics.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebellar dysfunction which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  The triphasic waves suggest that the encephalopathy is at least partly due to a metabolic derangement such as hepatic or liver disease.  No seizures were seen.

MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, Simvastatin, Zosyn, Vancomycin, Flagyl, Solu Medrol
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient is intubated and comatose.  The technologist observes that the patient has intermittent eye movements.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates primarily a burst suppression pattern with a markedly suppressed pattern.  In the bursts of activity that occur, there are bursts of high amplitude, sharply contoured faster frequency activity.  Some of these bursts begin on the left.  The duration of the bursts varies from 3 seconds to 10-15 seconds.  Many of the bursts, particularly those with high amplitude activity, are associated with eye blink.  At the beginning of a burst there are typically three eye blinks.  In addition, in some of the discharges when the patient has another high voltage burst within that burst, eye blink will be seen again. Later sections of the record demonstrate a burst and attenuation pattern with lower voltage theta, but the initial sections are markedly suppressed.
HR:    120 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
Burst suppression pattern.
What appears to be an ictal pattern with consistent pattern of eye blinking with high voltage discharges.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a very worrisome pattern, 18 hours following cardiac arrest.  Because of the correlation between the discharges on the EEG and the patient's clinical symptoms, this EEG should be considered ictal.

The patient was recorded during unresponsiveness.  No activating procedures were performed.  An EMG electrode was also added to the recording.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Continuous repetitive myogenic artifact seen over the right hemisphere.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffuse slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that, at best, reaches 6 to 7 Hz.  It does not appear to be reactive to eye opening.  There is no normal frontocentral beta.  There is no normal sleep architecture.  There are no activating procedures performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Generalized slow waves at 5 to 7 Hz seen continuously throughout the recording, at times with intermittent suppression and with a slight asymmetry in amplitude with higher frequencies over the left than the right.
There are focal sharp waves seen at CZ frequently
There are focal slow waves at CZ at 2 to 4 Hz and an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts.
The patient has twitching noted over the right hemispheric electrodes that occurs irregularly but almost continuously throughout the recording with no clear EEG correlate on the left hemisphere.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slow waves.
Right hemispheric decreased amplitude.
Central sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is nonspecific with regard to etiology but may be due, at least in part, to medication effect.  There is some loss of faster frequencies over the right hemisphere which may imply some cortical damage or overlying fluid collection in that region.  Lastly, there are also signs of focal cerebral dysfunction and irritability over the central region, which has a high correlation with acute injury in that region.  The facial twitching has no EEG correlate and may represent myoclonic jerks arising from an unknown source in the left hemisphere which cannot be seen in EEG.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This was an awake and a sleep record in very drowsy individual.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm, exceeding 70 mV with posterior slow waves of youth.  In drowsiness there is hypersynchronous rhythmic higher amplitude theta frequency activity “hypnogogic”, “hypersynchrony”.  There were 1 or 2 points of head rocking artifact and there were 1-2 bursts which are slightly asynchronous. Hyperventilation produces hypersynchronous rhythmic high amplitude, somewhat sharply contoured theta frequency activity, but no definitive spike and wave activity. The patient transitions in and out of stage II sleep with vertex waves and spindles.  Other features of drowsiness include the hypersynchronous rhythmic theta.
Photic stimulation elicits vigorous driving with harmonic and supraharmonic driving.
HR:    66 bpm
IMPRESSION:  This EEG demonstrates multiple normal variants for a young adult.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There was no definitive spike and wave activity, although hyperventilation did produce some rhythmic high amplitude theta.  There were a handful of slightly asynchronous bursts as the patient transitions to drowsiness.  If absence seizures are an important consideration, a repeat fasting EEG, perhaps with a second hyperventilation session maybe helpful.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a mildly diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 8 Hz and can only be seen over the left hemisphere.  Over the left hemisphere, there is normal amount of frontocentral beta, however, none can be seen over the right hemisphere.  Patient appears to be awake and go into stage change of sleep, but the classic sleep architecture is not seen. Activating procedures were not performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow sharp waves seen periodically in the right hemisphere usually maximal at F8/T4, however, at times more maximal at F8, at times even more maximal at T6 and some of them appear to be maximal at FP2.  These sharp waves were occurring periodically at a frequency of 0.5-1 Hz with an amplitude of 20-70 microvolts.  The periodicity is consistent with periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs).
Focal slow waves in the right hemisphere maximal at T4 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
Generalized slow waves at a frequency of 5-7 Hz with an amplitude of 20-40 microvolts seen continuously throughout the recording.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Right hemisphere periodic lateralized epileptic discharges maximally in the midtemporal region, although with broad field.
Mild generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of right hemispheric maximal in the midtemporal region, but with a broad field, cortical dysfunction and irritability, which is consistent with an acute lesion in that region.  In addition, there is evidence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures were seen.

INTRODUCTION:  A digital EEG was performed in the lab using a standard international 10-20 system of electrode placement in addition to one channel of EKG monitoring.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation are performed to see tracing captures wakefulness only.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the posterior dominant rhythm was asymmetric and characterized by 9-10 Hz in frequency, 30-40 microvolts in amplitude seen in the left occipital region and 8-8.5 Hz on the right side which attenuated with eye opening.  There was right hemispheric slowing in theta frequency and attenuation with loss of faster frequencies noted throughout the study. There were intermittent focal slowing in the left frontal and anterior temporal regions consisting of 5-6 Hz theta frequency activity with 30-40 microvolt amplitude lasting for 1-2 seconds, occasionally with a field to the left anterior and mid temporal region.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple/frequencies and result in no driving response. No epileptiform activity with seizures were seen in the study.  Heart rate was 90-100 beats per minute and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG recording capturing wakefulness only due to:
Right hemispheric attenuation and slowing with loss of faster frequencies.
Intermittent left frontotemporal slowing during wakefulness.  No epileptiform abnormalities or seizures were identified in this record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Diffuse attenuation and loss of faster frequencies in the right hemispheric could be seen in the structural lesions of the underlying cerebral cortex or fluid accumulation in the extra-axial space.  Right hemispheric slowing is suggestive of subcortical structure or functional abnormalities. Focal left frontal and temporal slowing could be suggestive of an underlying structural abnormality in the left hemisphere or left frontotemporal dysfunction.  Clinical correlation is recommended.

CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The background consists of frequent isolated bursts of high amplitude generalized spike and wave discharges followed by 3 to 5 seconds of burst suppression.  The longest burst of activity lasts approximately 6.5 seconds.  During longer bursts, there is predominantly bifrontal EMG artifact and rhythmic 2 to 3 Hz diffuse sharply contoured activity.  Review of the video demonstrates that brief bursts of activity as well as longer bursts of activity accompanied by eye flutter as well as rapid low amplitude head shaking.  These bursts are not time locked with ventilator artifact.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is right to left interhemispheric asymmetry with slow waveforms over the right hemisphere.  The posterior dominant rhythm over the left hemisphere consists of a well formed and modulated 9 to 10 Hertz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  Over the left hemisphere, there is preserved anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The posterior dominant rhythm over the right hemisphere is unstable and reaches about 9 Hertz alpha.  There is no clear anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The background over the right hemisphere consists of a mixture of polymorphic theta and delta activity with under-riding faster frequencies.  Slowing is more pronounced over the anterior temporal/frontal region.  The patient briefly falls asleep by the end of the recording.  Sleep spindles are captured only over the left hemisphere.  Brief 1 to 3-second bursts of frontally predominant rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA) are captured.  Occasional poorly formed, sharply contoured waveforms observed over the right midtemporal region with phase reversal over T4-T6 electrode.  Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation results in occipital driving only over the left hemisphere.
FINDINGS:
Continuous moderate slowing over the right hemisphere, most pronounced over the anterior temporal/frontal region.
Sharp waves over the right mid temporal region.
No electrographic seizures.
Asymmetry of sleep architecture with sleep better formed over the left hemisphere.
Asymmetrical occipital driving with driving only observed over the left hemisphere.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal 23-minute awake and briefly asleep EEG, due to continuous focal slowing over the right hemisphere that is most pronounced over the frontotemporal region and occasional epileptiform discharges over the right mid midtemporal region. These findings indicate focal cerebral dysfunction that carries increased epileptogenic potential. FIRDA is observed in encephalopathies, increase intracranial pressure, deep white matter lesions. No electrographic seizures are captured.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with symmetric reactive 10 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity.  In relaxed wakefulness, prior to hyperventilation, there are bursts of high amplitude, frontally predominant spike and slow wave activity, which are relatively symmetric.  The discharges are less than 2 seconds and start with a 5 Hz discharge transitioning more to a 3 Hz over time.  The bursts are so brief and they are not associated with impairment of awareness.  The technologist gives the patient tasks to do and she is able to count during these brief bursts which wax and wan.
Hyperventilation accentuates the bursts of frontally predominant spike and slow wave activity.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is a more of a polyspike component to the bursts.
Photic stimulation elicits a driving response.  It does not accentuate the epileptiform activity.  The epileptiform activity does occur around the time of stimulation, but it also occurs even just prior to her following the stimulation.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity. In relaxed wakefulness. There Is intermittent focal slowing identified from the right mid to anterior temporal region. Although there Is some artifacts noted in the record including the EKG artifact. There discreet spikes in the right anterior temporal at F8, T2. Hyperventilation is performed early in the record and seems to accentuate the slowing noted from the right. This is followed by drowsiness, which again accentuates the focal and low to medium amplitude sharp waves and spikes from the right anterior temporal region. As becomes drowsy, some of the these lower voltage spikes become a little bit more in morphology and more sustained bursts of focal slowing and additional sharp waves are noted as the patient becomes drowsy with the sharp waves starting to develop into bursts or trains which are not sustained.

Unfortunately, photic stimulation is performed just as the patient Is starting to transition this sleep pattern and a scant driving response was noted.
Immediately after photic stimulation, the patient transitions into stage II sleep with vertex waves and spindles and K complexes. The epileptiform activity was clearly accentuated by stage II sleep.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  Mu activity, as well as lambda was identified. The patient appears to be very sleepy, transitions in and out of stage II sleep.  Spindle activity is noted.  There seem to be fragments of sleep spindles just as she is dropping almost in and out wakefulness.  As the sleep record continues, more abundant stage II sleep is identified, but in the transition in and out of stage II sleep, there are fragments of early drowsiness, almost emerging into a stage II sleep pattern.

MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Catapres, others seizure medications and medications for depression.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This is a low voltage EEG in a patient who is quite sleepy, transitioning in and out of stage 2 sleep.  There is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  This low voltage EEG is best reviewed at 3 Hz.  There is rhythmic theta and even some delta noted in the right hemisphere.  Stage 2 sleep is relatively symmetric with vertex waves, K complexes and spindles.  As the patient transitions in and out of sleep, mu activity is noted in wakefulness.  As stage 2 sleep continues, shifting slowing is later noted in stage 2 sleep with a single sharp wave in the left hemisphere in stage 2 sleep.
Photic stimulation does active the record.  Heart rate 60 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a challenging, but abnormal EEG due to SHIFTING slowing at times with more rhythmic slowing from the right hemisphere, but occasionally in stage 2 sleep from the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Only a single sharp wave was identified from the left which therefore must be considered an artifact.  These findings may be correlated with imaging.  Focal slowing was noted, but unfortunately there was only a single sharp wave.  If additional information is needed for this individual with frequent seizures, inpatient or outpatient video EEG monitoring may be valuable.  The focal slowing on the right fits with a history of the right MCA infarct.

REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video long-term EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during lethargy and later on wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  During the first 3-4 hours of the recording, there is a diffuse delta pattern and slowing throughout the recording with a more prominent right hemispheric focal slowing maximal in the occipital lobe and some intermittent right temporal sharp waves.  This is also superimposed to O2 PLEDs that were seen continuously at 1-2 Hz.  About 4 in the morning, this pattern appeared to improve and faster frequencies started to appear over the central and frontal regions of the recording.  The EEG continued to improve over the next hours with some normal sleep architecture and the faster frequencies over the right hemisphere.  By 2 p.m., the faster frequencies and the posterior dominant rhythm during wakefulness appears to be 9 Hz with a normal frontocentral beta.  At that point, there is intermittent right hemispheric slowing, but not as frequent as before and some intermittent FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity).  By the end of the recording, there is a lot of muscle artifact which makes it difficult for visualization, permits limits visualization of the EEG.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  As above, described as at onset, there were O2 PLEDs and focal slowing in the right hemisphere, maximal at O2 with some intermittent T4 sharp waves and generalized slowing.  This continued to improve until the end of the recording where the EEG almost normalizes.  However, there is some intermittent FIRDA.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Right occipital periodic lateralized epileptic discharges and right midtemporal sharp waves in addition to right hemispheric slowing maximal at the occipital region which improved and with intermittent FIRDA.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal structural dysfunction and irritability of the right hemisphere, maximal in the occipital region in addition to some generalized dysfunction.  All of these findings appear to have improved markedly over the last 24 hours.  No seizures were seen.

INTRODUCTION:
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The patient is asleep throughout the majority of the EEG.  During very brief wakefulness, there is a posterior dominant rhythm of 8.5 Hz with anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  Throughout the majority of the study, the patient is asleep with vertex waves, sleep spindles, and POSTS seen.  Also, REM sleep is observed by the end of the recording.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  No epileptiform discharges were observed.
FINDINGS:  Primarily asleep study to REM sleep at the end of the recording.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal primarily asleep and briefly awake EEG due to excessive drowsiness and REM sleep captured on a 22-minute study.  These findings indicate excessive drowsiness.  In a routine EEG, a finding of REM sleep is abnormal.  In a proper clinical setting, further investigation to causes of excessive sleepiness may be considered.  The lack of epileptiform discharges in a routine EEG does not exclude the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some electrode artifact and muscle artifact seen throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no posterior dominant rhythm and no normal frontal central beta.  There was no normal sleep architecture.  No activating procedures were performed.  The background is consistent of generalized slow waves at a delta frequency at 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 mV.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:

Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-60 mV seen continuously throughout the recording.
At two points during the study there was a rhythmic run of A1 sharp waves that lasted 5-10 seconds with no clear evolution.  There was no video correlate or clinical correlate to this discharge.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Left frontal central and temporal sharp waves.
Two runs of sharp waves in the left temporal lobe
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with seizures likely arising from the left frontal central region and/or the mid temporal region.  In addition, there is evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in this region which has a high correlation with a structural lesion in that region.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while unresponsive.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a disorganized slow background that consists of bursts of diffuse theta activity which in the posterior region reaches at best a frequency of 7-8 Hz.  In between these bursts of theta activity, there appears to be complete suppression activity that lasts as long as 10 seconds in between bursts.  The bursts consist mainly of theta, delta activity, at times having some vertex-like waves suggestive of stage 1 sleep, although no clear sleep-wake cycle is noted.  During the study, the patient is stimulated and there appears to be a reactivity with the EEG with some faster frequencies and some muscle activity coming through.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Again, generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz with intermixed burst suppression lasting up to 10 seconds.
SEIZURES:  None.

Events:  The patient had about 9 events which consisted of him pressing the alarm, suddenly his arms would become flexed, and he would become stiff and grimacing his face, lasting for about 20-30 seconds, during the episode and after which he would be unresponsive for another 2-3 minutes.  The behavior was very similar to the ones that he described before and every episode remained the same.  During these episodes the EEG would have a diffuse muscle artifact, but underlying it there would be a normal posterior dominant rhythm and no epileptiform discharges prior to the flexing, posturing, or after when he would remain unresponsive.

IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal 23-minute awake and asleep EEG due to mild diffuse slowing, moderate bifrontal slowing, and occasional frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA).  Diffuse slowing is a nonspecific indicator of diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Focal bifrontal slowing may be indicative of bifrontal structural abnormalities. FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity) is a nonspecific finding and could be seen in encephalopathy, increased intracranial pressure, and deep white
matter abnormalities.  No epileptiform discharges are captured.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.

1642,"CLINICAL HISTORY:  81 year old right handed woman with long standing history of narcolepsy.
MEDICATIONS:  Naprosyn, Levothyroxine, ASA, Dextroamphetamine, Paxil.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.   Photic stimulation was performed.
LENGTH OF RECORDING:  23 minutes.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well formed and regulated 10 Hz alpha that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  Excess beta is observed.  No sleep is captured.  No epileptiform discharges are present. Hyperventilation was not performed. Photic stimulation results in appropriate occipital driving at mid-to-high range frequencies.
HR:  Regular.
FINDINGS:
No stage 2 sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
Excess beta.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake only, 23-minute EEG.  Excess beta could be a result of medication, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  No epileptiform discharges were captured, but stage 2 sleep was not achieved.  If clinical diagnosis of epilepsy remains, a repeat EEG with sleep capture may be of benefit.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on the routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to superior frequency amplitude gradient.  Large portions of the EEG consist of diffuse significant muscle artifact that obscures large portions of the EEG.  Visible underlying activity consists of a mixture of low amplitude polymorphic theta mixed with faster frequencies.  During periods of relative quiescence the recording consists of bursts of diffuse spindle like wave forms mixed with frequent periods of brief 1 to 2 second discontinuities.  No clear epileptiform discharges are captured.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  Increase in the heart rate is noted on the single EKG lead at the end of the recording.
FINDINGS:
Moderate diffuse slowing.
Excess beta.
Background discontinuity.
No electrographic seizures.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal 22 minute EEG due to diffuse background slowing and periods of discontinuity.  These findings indicate nonspecific cerebral dysfunction, that in this case could partially be related to medication affect.  Excess beta is likely related to medication affect, benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  No clear electrographic seizures are captured.

The patient has now developed multiple episodes of loss of consciousness without shaking, but with eye twitching.  The patient may demonstrate strange behavior during these spells.  The patient can be aggressive during these spells.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This was an awake and a sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 10.7 Hz alpha rhythm and generous, low voltage, frontal central beta.
During hyperventilation the patient reported feeling that her left side felt heavy and her left face was drooping, but the EEG demonstrated a normal awake pattern.
Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.

MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Keppra, Risperdal, Risperidone
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  There is excess theta in apparent wakefulness.  There is sometimes a background of more rhythmic theta.
Interictal findings for this individual include frontal fast activity, right more so than the left with a subtle frontal sharp wave underlying and a sharp wave can be seen at  Fp2-F4 with a small amount of bilateral representation.  Rare, higher amplitude left mid temporal sharp waves were identified.
Hyperventilation was performed early in the record producing rhythmic slowing particularly in the frontal regions.  The hyperventilation response included some arrhythmic slowing.  Features of drowsiness included slow rolling eye movements, slowing of  the alpha rhythm, and increase in overall background slowing, but deeper stages of sleep were not sustained. Photic stimulation did not activate the record.
HR:    66 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Frontal fast activity with a right frontal underlying sharp wave.
Left anterior temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a focal mechanism for epilepsy and raises the possibility of more than one mechanism for seizures.  Left anterior temporal sharp waves, right temporal sharp waves and bifrontal sharp waves were noted in a previous EEG in 2008.

1671,"LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  23 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 63-year-old woman with past medical history of atrial fibrillation and metastatic ovarian cancer who underwent left frontal craniotomy on 08/21/2012.  She now presents with expressive aphasia and generalized weakness.
MEDICATIONS:  Dexamethasone, Lovenox and metoprolol.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and  T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The background consists of low to moderate amplitude  polymorphic mixture of theta and delta with occasional triphasic wave forms.  Additional intermittent theta and delta are captured over the left frontocentral region.   Sleep is not captured.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  No electrographic seizures are seen.  A single EKG lead demonstrates irregular heart rate with a heart rate up to 150 beats per minute.
FINDINGS:
Moderate diffuse slowing.
Focal left frontocentral slowing.
Cardiac arrhythmia.
No electrographic seizures.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal 23-minute awake only EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing and focal left frontocentral slowing and triphasic wave forms.  Diffuse slowing indicates etiologically nonspecific cerebral dysfunction that in his case could partially be related to toxic metabolic etiology.  Triphasic waves are observed in different forms of encephalopathy.  Focal left frontocentral slowing could be secondary to an underlying cerebral dysfunction that is structural in etiology and is consistent with the patient's history of left frontal craniotomy.  Cardiac arrhythmia with heart rate up to 150 beats a minute is noted in the single EKG lead.  No clear electrographic seizures are captured.

INTRODUCTION:  A digital EEG was performed in the laboratory using the standard international 10-20 system of electrode placement, in addition to T1 and T2 electrodes and 1 channel of EKG monitoring.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This tracing captures wakefulness through stage II sleep.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the alpha rhythm is 10.5 to 11.5 Hz in frequency, 30-40 microvolts in amplitude seen in the occipital region which attenuates with eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude frontal central beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  Stage I sleep is characterized by disappearance of the alpha rhythm, slowing of the background, and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact, as well as the presence of vertex sharp waves and POSTS.  Stage II sleep is characterized by the presence of K complexes and sleep spindles.  Hyperventilation results in symmetrical slowing of the background activity.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and results in a symmetric driving response.  Heart rate was 70 to 80 beats per minute and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG recording capturing wakefulness through stage II sleep.  No epileptiform abnormalities were identified in this record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A normal EEG does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are clinical concern, a repeat EEG or a 24-hour ambulatory EEG may be helpful.

MEDICATIONS:  Insulin, Keppra, and enalapril.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity.  In relaxed wakefulness there is a small amount of shifting slowing with occasional, independent right or left temporal slowing.
Hyperventilation was performed early in the record producing an increase in theta, a little bit more so on the left than the right.  Some of this was rhythmic, but some was somewhat arrhythmic as well.
Sleep was characterized by a prominent increase in beta.  Spindles were noted.  Again, there was a small amount of shifting slowing noted in sleep.  Vertex waves and POSTS were also seen.  As the patient transitions in and out of sleep, there was some rhythmic, hypnagogic hypersynchrony.
Photic stimulation was performed at the end of the record when the patient was awake.  A normal background was noted at that time.  Despite the tech's attempt to maintain him in an awake state during photic stimulation, the patient started to drift off to sleep during photic.  A driving response was elicited.
Heart rate:  78 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a mildly abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to: Occasional bursts of shifting slowing noted as the patient transitions in and out of drowsiness and in hyperventilation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No sharp waves or spikes were seen.  There were no specific hallmarks of an underlying seizure disorder.  The shifting slowing noted in the transition to sleep is characteristic of that seen in older adults with cerebrovascular disease.  It is, however, a nonspecific finding.

SEIZURES:  At 1:21 p.m. the EEG recording suddenly stopped and the recording restarts at 1:24 p.m.  At this point there is a clear prefrontal rhythmic discharge consistent of sharp waves maximal mainly at FP1, but at times at FP2 at a frequency of 3-4 Hz going on continuously with no clear clinical correlate.  This pattern is consistent with an electrographic seizure.  The electrographic seizure continues without stopping until about almost 19 minutes later after receiving Ativan at 1:39 p.m.  After that the EEG appears to go back to a diffusely slow background with some prefrontal slowing.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to an electrographic prefrontal maximal seizure with no clear onset seen as well as bifrontal slowing and generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals electrographic seizures which appears to be maximally in the frontal region.  In addition, there is evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the frontal region as well as diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology, but is likely related to the hypoxic injury.  These findings were discussed with the team and the patient will be placed on long-term monitoring.

MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, lisinopril, others.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is diffusely slow and poorly organized.  Both hemispheres are somewhat slow and disorganized with a posterior dominant rhythm of 6-7 Hz.  There is disruption of faster frequency activity noted from the left hemisphere.  There are bursts of frontally prominent regular or irregular delta noted.  Rhythmic delta activity is also observed in the occipital regions, right or left with an occipital sharp wave which is almost at the midline.  In addition, there are rare left central sharp waves maximum at C3 in wakefulness, there is an increase in more rhythmic theta frequency activity and the alpha rhonchi is a bit better defined on the right.  Photic stimulation did not significantly activate the record.  Heart rate sometimes irregular, 72 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing and disorganization.
Superimposed focal features with disruption of faster frequency activity on the left compared to the right.
Sharp waves noted including left central as well as others that are occipital in nature.

INTRODUCTION:  A digital EEG was performed in the laboratory using the standard International 10-20 System of electrode placement in addition to T1 and T2 electrodes and 1 channel of EKG monitoring, hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This tracing captures wakefulness through drowsiness.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  In the most alert state, the alpha rhythm is 10-11 Hz in frequency, 70-75 microvolts in amplitudes seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude frontocentral beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  Drowsiness is characterized by disappearance of the alpha rhythm, slowing of the background, and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact.  Hyperventilation results in symmetrical slowing of the background activity.  Photic stimulation was performed and multiple flash frequencies and results in a symmetric driving response.

INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded while minimally responsive.  Activating procedures were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 6 to 7 Hz, which appears to be somewhat reactive to eye opening.  There is no normal frontocentral beta.  Overall, the background is diffusely slow in a theta-delta frequency and appears to be asymmetrically faster over the left hemisphere. The right hemisphere reveals focal slowing.  In addition, there is again generalized slowing maximally bifrontally.
Heart rate 84 and irregular.
Abnormal discharges:
Focal sharp waves seen occasionally at F4 while unresponsive.
Focal slow waves seen over the right hemisphere, maximal at F8/T4 at a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz and an amplitude of 20 to 40 microvolts.

INTRODUCTION:  A digital EEG was performed in the lab using the standard international 10-20 system of electrode placement in addition to 1 channel of EKG monitoring.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  These tracing captures wakefulness through short period of drowsiness.  In the most alert state, the alpha rhythm is 9 to 9.5 hertz in frequency, 30-40 microvolts in amplitude, seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude frontocentral beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  Drowsiness is characterized by disappearance of the alpha rhythm, slowing of the background, and absence of muscle and eye-blink artifacts.  There are intermittent periods of bitemporal slowing at F7/T3 and F8/T4 during wakefulness and short period of drowsiness consisting of 3 hertz delta frequency, 50-60 microvolt in amplitude lasting 1-2 seconds.  Hyperventilation resulted in slowing seen in most cerebral hemispheres.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple fresh frequencies and resulting in a driving response.  Heart rate was 70-80 beats per minute and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to bitemporal slowing during wakefulness and short period of drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The above findings are suggestive of bilateral structural abnormalities or bilateral cerebral dysfunction.  Other causes included toxic metabolic or infectious encephalopathy, or degenerative causes.  There were no epileptiform abnormalities or seizures noted during this study.  The abscess of epileptiform abnormalities does not exclude to possibility of epilepsy or intermittent seizures.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was awake and conversant throughout.  He has a prominent, frontal craniotomy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This is an unusual and dynamic EEG.  Some sections of the record demonstrate a pretty well organized background with a lower voltage alpha rhythm of 11 Hz and some lower voltage frontocentral theta.  Other sections of the record demonstrated bursts of high amplitude, bifrontal sharp waves or spikes.  These occur with the patient relaxing comfortably but were accentuated by hyperventilation.  The epileptiform activity is usually bilateral but can be maximum in the right or left frontal region.  There can be a polyspike component at FP1, F3 or FP2.  The bursts of slow spike-and-wave activity are associated with background slowing, and bursts of epileptiform activity or bursts of slowing with epileptiform may be on the order of two seconds or longer.  Aside from these bursts, the patient is awake, alert, and conversant.  The bursts are brief enough that it is difficult to determine if they are clinically significant.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was quite drowsy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG includes a breach rhythm with considerably higher amplitude activity on the left compared to the right.  As the EEG begins, the patient is asleep with generous beta of 13 Hz in the frontocentral region, but without some of the typical features of stage II sleep.  The activity on the right is lower voltage and slow.  With stimulation, there is some sharply contoured activity appearing at T5 and T1.  Higher amplitude focal delta is noted throughout the left hemisphere and varies from left frontocentral to mid to posterior temporal region.  As the patient becomes a bit sleepier, the activity on the right is lower voltage and slower.  In sleep, despite the breach rhythm, there is more of a left parietal focus.  Photic stimulation did not activate the record.
Heart rate 90 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slowing from the left hemisphere with variability, but in sleep much more prominent in the left parietal region.
Sharply contoured slowing in the context of a breach rhythm with suggestion of a left parietal sharp wave.
Some sharp wave contoured wave forms in the left frontocentral or frontotemporal region, as well.
In wakefulness, the background is also slow on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a structural or functional abnormality on the left, congruent with a previous tumor and surgical history.  The foci of sharply contoured slowing is more prominent in the left parietal region in sleep, but is a little bit more anteriorly when the patient is stimulated.  The bilateral background slowing may be due to a diffuse brain process or postictal state.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the emergency room using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was somnolent, but sometimes responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly slow.  Superimposed upon the slow background there are sharp waves, some periodic slowing and some periodic sharps noted in the left  hemisphere typically at T1, but with some variability, T1, F7 and T3.  Stimulation of the patient does produce an alerting response with a glimpse of an alpha on the right, but the patient remains somnolent.  Unfortunately, stimulation of the patient also produces a fair amount of artifact.  In an averaged reference, the epileptiform activity is maximum at F7 with a variable field in the left anterior temporal or frontotemporal.
Heart rate 84 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slowing from the left frontotemporal region.
Sharp waves, periodic complexes and periodic delta in the left frontal and frontotemporal region with variability.
Background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  As the recording continues, with stimulation of the patient there is an increase in faster frequency activity on the right.  However, the periodic activity and the sharp waves on the left have not abated, although there are no clinical seizures.  Ongoing clinical evaluation is warranted.

INTRODUCTION:  A digital EEG was performed in ICU using the standard international 10/20 system of electrode placement in addition to two T1-T2 electrodes and 1 channel of EKG monitoring.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  This tracing captures the patient in a comatose state, sedated state.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the comatose/sedated state, there was seen diffuse attenuation of the background with intermittent EKG artifacts.  There was unknown artifact in bilateral frontoparietal regions likely due to a ventilators.  There was seen very low voltage 1.5 Hz delta frequency activity and occasional 3 Hz delta frequency activity of 5-10 microvolt amplitude.  There was seen no spontaneous variability and reactivity on stimulating the patient.  No seizures or epileptiform activity was seen during this recording.  Heart rate was 80-90 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG recording capturing the patient in a comatose/sedative state due to diffuse slowing and attenuation of the background.  No seizures or epileptiform activity was seen during this recording.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Diffuse slowing and attenuation of the background are suggestive of severe anoxic encephalopathy.  Alternatively, it could be due to severe metabolic or infectious encephalopathy or due to effect of medications or bilateral cerebral dysfunction.  In addition, diffuse attenuation could be seen in bilateral fluid collection in the extra-axial space or the overlying skull.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  No epileptiform abnormalities or seizures were captured.  This does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy or of intermittent seizures.  If clinically indicated, a continuous bedside EEG monitoring may be helpful.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This is an awake and drowsy EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal.  Sections of the record include a rhythmic approximately 7 Hz theta frequency background with a 7-8 Hz alpha rhythm, but much of the record include significantly more slower rhythmic mixed theta and delta.  Superimposed upon this is some focal slowing with a bit more arrhythmic alpha on the left compared to the right and disruption of faster frequency activity.  In addition, occasional sharp waves are noted independently at T4, P4 and T1.  Sharp waves are relatively infrequent.  Stimulation of the patient produces an alerting response with an increase in the faster frequency activity.  Rare triphasic waves were observed.  Heart rate 97 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Intermittent, paroxysmal slowing.
Superimposed asymmetry with disruption of faster frequency activity on the left in comparison to the right.
Independent sharp waves seen from either hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function affecting gray and white matter.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab  using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was initially somnolent, then inattentive.  This was an awake through stage II sleep record.  After the patient drifted off to sleep, it was somewhat difficult to awaken the patient.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The tracing begins with stage II sleep with central spindle activity.  Focal slowing is noted from the left temporal region with left temporal sharp waves.  The sharp waves are mid to anterior temporal with a generous field spread.  They are discrete, at 70 microvolts at the maximum.  In the T1 and T2 montage they are maximum at T1.
The patient is still quite drowsy during photic stimulation.  During photic stimulation, there are trains of left anterior temporal sharp waves as the patient transitions in and out of stage II sleep.
The technologist attempts to awaken the patient for hyperventilation without success.  The patient remains in stage II sleep again with prominent sharp waves from the left temporal region.
Heart rate 96 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Left anterior temporal sharp waves.
Left temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are relatively characteristic of temporal lobe epilepsy.  This patient's postictal state may account for the hypersomnolence as it might be the use of benzodiazepines.

1763,"REASON FOR STUDY:  Hypoxic injury.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 48-year-old man found unresponsive with carbon monoxide poisoning on December 1st, with a history of hypertension and alcohol abuse, left foot ischemia, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, bacteremia and pneumonia.
MEDICATIONS:  Insulin, aspirin, Lovenox, vitamins, Coreg, thiamine, vancomycin, Lipitor.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  Overall, the patient's background is mainly in the theta frequently at 5-7 Hz and amplitude of 20-40 microvolts.  The patient does appear to be reactive to commands and there is variability in the EEG upon stimulation.  The patient did have photic stimulation which revealed no abnormal discharges.
Heart rate 84.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Diffuse slow waves seen at 5-7 Hz and amplitude of 20-40 microvolts continuously throughout the recording.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to mild-to-moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of mild-to-moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology, but is likely related to the carbon monoxide/hypoxic injury.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.

INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while slightly responsive while sedated.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some movement artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Overall, there is a diffusely slow background in the delta frequency at 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-30 microvolts seen continuously.  At times, there is intermittent triphasic live waveforms which appear to be symmetric and maximally center frontally and at times periodic.
SEIZURES:  None.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-30 microvolts seen continuously.
Triphasic waves.
Heart rate 180, irregular.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to generalized slowing as well as triphasics.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  However, the triphasics suggest at least a possible metabolic component.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.

Bursts of delta.
Mild shifting and slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In this individual with both a neurodegenerative process with dementia, such as Parkinson's disease and severe traumatic brain injury.  This EEG demonstrates a slow background.  There was a section where the patient seemed to be awake with tremor and there was an emergence of an alpha rhythm but the patient did not seem to be very interactive at that time.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was confused.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG includes a fair amount of muscle and movement artifact.  There is a mixed frequency pattern with generous faster frequency activity and some slow activity with a mixture of theta/delta.  There is a great deal of chew artifact noted.  Shifting asymmetries were observed.  Very brief epochs to suggest stage I sleep were noted, followed immediately by spontaneous agitation.
Heart rate 84 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Background slowing and disorganization.
Prominent shifting slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Sleep was not sustained.  There is shifting slowing in the sleep morphologies as well as in the overall background.  These findings may be correlated with imaging.  No epileptiform features were identified, but a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy should be considered.

INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was performed in the lab using a standard international 10-20 system of electrode placement in addition to T1 and T2 electrode and 1 channel of EKG monitoring.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  This tracing captured wakefulness only.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the alpha rhythm is 8.5-9 Hz in frequency 30-40 microvolts in amplitude seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude frontal central beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  No epileptiform activities or seizures are identified during this recording.  Heart rate is 70 beats per minute and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG recording capturing wakefulness only.  No epileptiform abnormalities were identified in this record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A normal EEG and does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are of clinical concern, a repeat EEG capturing deeper stages of sleep or a 24-hour ambulatory EEG may be helpful.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a lower voltage pattern with generous beta.  There is a slight asymmetry with a slight disruption of beta activity in the right central region related to the left.  There is a single subtle right frontal sharp wave.
Heart rate 104.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to
Replacement of normal background with diffuse beta.
Very subtle right-sided slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The use of sedative or hypnotic medications, would produce the beta activity described above.  Given the magnitude of the patient's hemorrhage, the right central slowing is more subtle than one would expect.  In this patient with a history of frontal encephalomalacia, there was only a single right frontal sharp wave, which was of no clear clinical significance.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.   Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the EEG is somewhat slow.  In addition, there is an apparent breach rhythm present, but not prominent on the right with higher amplitude activity on that side.  Intermittent focal slowing is noted on the right with some sharp wave contours, delta in the right central temporal region.  Alerting seems to ameliorate this.  Photic stimulation elicits scant bilateral driving.  Heart rate 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Mild, generalized background slowing.
Somewhat subtle right central temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a structural functional abnormality on the right.  In comparison to a previous study on November 9, the focal slowing and the background slowing are markedly improved.  No definitive sharp waves or spikes were noted and no seizures were recorded.

INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using a standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while awake and sleep, stage I and stage II.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  There was a continuously seen overriding 60 Hz artifact which is eliminated partly with the notch filter, however, presents clear identification of all the wave forms in the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz when awake and has some frontal central beta.  No activating procedures were performed.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and stage I and stage II sleep.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None clearly seen.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Limited normal awake and asleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This limited EEG in wakefulness and sleep is normal, however, note that the overriding artifact required a notch filter to be used for review of the EEG and all the wave forms cannot be clearly identified as factual. Repeated EEG addressing this issue may be helpful if the clinical diagnosis or epilepsy and seizures is a concern.

INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 to 10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Photic stimulation produces no abnormal discharges.
Abnormal discharges:
Very frequent, at times rhythmic sharp waves seen over F7/T3 and at times at T3 during wakefulness and sleep, as well independent also frequent sharp waves over F8/T4, also seen during wakefulness and sleep; however, the majority of the sharp waves are seen mainly in sleep and appear to attenuate with eye opening and wakefulness.
Focal slow waves over the left hemisphere at F7/T3 at a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz and an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts and independently at F8/T4, seen occasionally at a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz and an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts.
Seizures:  None.
Heart rate 78, regular.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to very frequent left anterior temporal and independent right anterior temporal sharp waves in wakefulness and sleep, as well as focal slowing in those regions.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with seizures likely arising from either anterior temporal region.  In addition, there is evidence of independent focal cerebral dysfunction in the bilateral anterior temporal regions, both of which are nonspecific in regard to etiology.  No seizures were seen.  Please note that this EEG is not that dissimilar to the reported EEG done on August 1, 2011.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.  This was a very drowsy patient.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there was a 10.5-Hz alpha rhythm.  The patient quickly transitioned to a drowsy pattern with prominent slowing of the alpha rhythm. Vertex waves were noted in stage 1 sleep.  As the patient drifted off to sleep, there was an involuntary jerk of the right leg. This was not associated with epileptiform features.  Cognitive testing was performed at the end to make sure that the patient was maximally awake and there was an awake pattern and then the patient quickly started to become a little drowsy with slowing of the alpha rhythm.
Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.  Heart rate 66 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is within normal limits for an adult of this age.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform activity was noted.  Sleep myoclonus was noted on one occasion which does not carry an EEG correlate.  This patient appears to be excessively drowsy which could be related to sleep deprivation or the use of opiate medications as described above.

Focal slow waves seen at C4/F4 at 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-100 mV also seen continuously throughout the recording.
Generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 mV seen continuously throughout the recording.
SEIZURES:  During the recording at one point the rhythmic PLED'S appeared to increase in frequency and evolve to infrequency and decreasing amplitude for about 1 minute and 20 seconds.  In the video there does not appear to be a clinical correlate which is consistent with an electrographic seizure.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Right frontal central PLED'S.
One electrographic seizure.
Generalized slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals one single electrographic seizure coming from the right fronto-central region. In addition, there is evidence of acute structural dysfunction and irritability in the right frontal central region which is consistent with the known frontal mass.  There was also evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology and may be due, at least in part, to medication effect.

MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION:  A digital EEG was performed in the lab  using the standard International 10-20 system of electrode placement in addition to one channel of EKG monitoring.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This tracing captures wakefulness only.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the alpha rhythm is 9 to 10 Hz in frequency, 30 to 40 microvolt in amplitude seen the occipital region which attenuates with eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude frontocentral beta activity which is distributed symmetrically.  Hyperventilation results in symmetric slowing of the background.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple/frequencies and resulted in a symmetric driving response.  Heart rate is 60 to 70 beats per minute and regular.
CLINICAL EVENTS:  A 10:00:43 the patient reported that she has an attack described as her stomach is jumping with her arm on top of it.  She added that this is part of her attack.  At 10:06:01 she reported that she is feeling hot.  At 10:11:54 she stated that she is seeing blinking red stuff that hurts.  EEG showed a normal awake pattern with a posterior dominant rhythm of 9 to 10 Hz.  Eye blink artifact, lateral eye movement artifacts and muscle artifact with no epileptiform activity during this event.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG recording capturing wakefulness only.  No epileptiform abnormalities were identified in this record.  The episodes were characterized by clinical events of jumping stomach, feeling hot, and seeing blinking red stuff without any significant EEG correlation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This study does not support the diagnosis of epilepsy.  The episodes are diagnostic for psychogenic nonepileptiform events.  Although this study does not exclude the possibility of epilepsy and intermittent seizures, if seizures are a clinical concern a prolonged ambulatory EEG may be helpful to capture other types of events.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient is intubated and poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly slow.  Relatively low voltage.  It includes slow featureless delta and some more scant rhythmic theta with a few bursts of more paroxysmal rhythmic low voltage theta.  In addition, there is a periodic transient noted in the right posterior quadrant.  Sometimes this appears as a pled, other times as slow delta.  It starts at P4 and ends at O2.  It is sometimes spikier at O2 than it is at P2, but occurs first at P4.  As the recording continues, this abnormality is less prominent and appears as an infrequent, periodic delta burst. Stimulation of the patient clearly produces a reactivity with an increase in faster frequency activity.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is slow and disorganized with an alpha rhythm of about 6-7 Hz in a pattern more of diffuse theta.  This background is intermittently disrupted by bursts of higher amplitude slowing, which are bilateral, but are more prominent on the left compared to the right.  In a disorganized pattern there is an underlying sharp wave which may be in the left mid to anterior temporal region.  In addition, as the patient transitions into stage 1 sleep with vertex waves, some of these waves forms are also noted.  In stage 1 sleep there appears to be a left posterior temporal sharp wave noted.
In the transition between wakefulness and sleep, there is intermittent disruption of the alpha rhythm on either side.
Hyperventilation produced an increase in amplitude of the background with hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing.  In addition, it does seem to elicit some asynchronous slowing and there is a question of a frontal spike and slow wave complex, left greater than right, noted in hyperventilation.

Bursts of shifting slowing were noted with sharply contoured delta with a broad field of spread in the right temporal region, but also right central parietal region.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing.  As the patient drifts off to sleep, snore artifact was noted and snoring functioned as an arousal for this individual.  Following snoring, the patient was waking up with an actually a faster alpha rhythm of 7.5 Hz.
Photic stimulation did not significantly active the record.

MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
This is an awake and asleep record in a very drowsy patient.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing begins, the patient is in stage 2 sleep with vertex waves and spindles.  With stimulation as the patient awakens from sleep, brief, frontal polyspike complexes were observed.  This was followed by a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm and then new activity of 10 Hz although testing was not performed to confirm the presence of new.
Hyperventilation was performed after this which did not produce an alerting response.  Following hyperventilation, the patient drifted back into stage 2 sleep with vertex wave, K-complexes, spindles and posts.
Photic stimulation was remarkable for photoelectric artifact.
Heart rate:  60 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a subtly abnormal EEG due to rare, frontally predominant polyspike activity which was elicited when the patient was awakened from stage 2 sleep.  This activity is approximately 6.5 Hz.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Although the epileptiform activity described above is subtle and is seen in a record with frontal muscle artifact, there is a clear frontal 6.5 Hz spike and wave or polyspike and wave discharge noted in the arousal from sleep.  This seems to be frontally predominant and bilaterally symmetric and more compatible with a generalized mechanism for epilepsy.

The generalized slowing is suggestive of a diffuse process, such as toxic metabolic process versus medication induced versus a postictal state.
Left focal slowing, which is continuous and most pronounced in the left frontocentral and mid temporal regions is suggestive of an underlying structural abnormality, which is consistent with a known stroke in that region.
The left temporal sharps are consistent with epileptogenicity at T3 that places this patient at high risk of localization-related epilepsy.  Clinical correlation is recommended.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 74-year-old right-handed woman status post cardiac arrest on 03/17/2013.  No CPR at home but intubated by EMS.  Critically ill patient.  Additional history not available but plan is for hypothermic protocol.
MEDICATIONS:  Fentanyl, Demerol, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital EEG was performed at the bedside in the ICU, using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient had not been paralyzed.  She had not achieved the hypothermic goal or hyperthermia had not been started at the time of the record at 16:05.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Background EEG demonstrates a burst suppression pattern with approximately 2 bursts every 20 seconds.  The bursts are 1 to 3 seconds in duration, and are associated with a little bit of jerking and oral facial movements.  In addition, in the period of time when the EEG is suppressed, following the bursts there is a very slow oral movement and then eye flicker, a bit of jerking, and oral bursts, and then the mouth opening and closing one more time while the EEG is suppressed.  Tactile stimulation does not activate the record.
The bursts of activity are high amplitude, almost with a 4Hz spike and wave-like burst and then a suppressed background.
Heart rate difficult to discern at times due to the background artifact, but 96 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Replacement of normal background with a burst suppression pattern.
Postanoxic myoclonus with the bursts with oral facial movements.
Absence of reactivity or significant variability.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These are worrisome findings, more than 6 hours status post anoxic insult.  Due to this patient's cardiac condition, hypothermia protocol was initiated and additional EEG will follow.

MEDICATIONS:  Narcotics, zonisamide, primidone, benzodiazepines.  Will add the rest later.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with an anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while lethargic.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no posterior dominant rhythm or frontal central beta.  There is no normal sleep architecture.  No activating procedures were performed.  Overall the background is of low amplitude consistent with delta slowing at 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of less than 20 microvolts seen continuously.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal sharp waves seen frequently at C44/F4 seen almost continuously throughout the recording.
Focal slow waves seen continuously at C44/F4 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-70 microvolts with additional asymmetric increased amplitude and faster frequencies consistent with a breach.
SEIZURES:  Throughout the recording, there were about 6 seizures which appeared to have an electrographic onset, sometimes at O2 and at times at C4 beginning with high-frequency beta discharge that could again start on the occipital region or the central region and increase in frequency and then in amplitude, later to slow down in frequency but increase in amplitude and would spread either from the occipital region towards the central region at C4 or from the central region to the occipital region and continue to evolve.  They would last for about 1 minute to 2 minutes.  Clinically, the patient appears to open his eyes and roll his eyes towards the right and may have some twitching of his arm and mouth movements.  The tech did question him once and he remained unresponsive.
HEART RATE:  120s between seizures and 134 while having a seizure.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to recurrent seizures as well as right central focal slowing and sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of status epilepticus with multiple seizures arising either from the right occipital or central region.  In addition, there is evidence of focal cerebral, structural cerebral dysfunction and irritability over the right central and frontal region.  These findings were discussed with the primary team as soon as the EEG was read.  Long-term EEG will be performed.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using a standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  In the most alert state, alpha rhythm is 9 Hz in frequency seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude frontocentral beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  Drowsiness is characterized by disappearance of the alpha rhythm, slowing of the background and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact.  Stage 1 sleep is characterized by the presence of vertex sharp waves and POSTS.  Stage 2 sleep is characterized by the presence of K complexes and sleep spindles.  Heart rate was 80 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG recording capturing wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.  No epileptiform abnormalities were identified in this record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A normal EEG does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are a clinical concern, a repeat EEG capturing deeper stages of sleep or a 24-hour ambulatory EEG may be helpful.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the bedside using standard international 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG monitoring.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulations are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, there is a slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm consisting of 7-7.5 Hz frequency activity.  There is excess 5-6 Hz theta activity during short periods of wakefulness.  There is low amplitude, generalized beta activity throughout the recording.  There are almost continuous bifrontal sharply contoured delta activity with a frequency of 2-3.5 Hz.  At times associated with occasional sharp and slow wave activity with no evolution.  There is also almost continuous delta activity noted in right temporal region.  Stage 1 sleep was seen as evidenced by vertex waves and posts.  Stage 2 sleep was seen as evidenced by sleep spindles and K complexes.  The heart rate was 80 beats per minute and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG recording due to:
Diffuse slowing of the background and posterior dominant rhythm.
Bifrontal slowing almost continuously with sharply contoured configurations.
Occasional bifrontal sharp and slow waves activities with no evolution.
Right temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Diffuse slowing and slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm are suggestive of metabolic toxic, anoxic, or infectious encephalopathy.  Alternatively, it could be due to the effect of medications or bilateral cerebral dysfunction.  Continuous slowing of bifrontal region is consistent with structural lesions in these regions.  The presence of sharp and slow waves is suggestive of underlying epileptogenicity.  Continuous slowing of temporal region is also consistent with a structural lesions in this area.  Generalized beta activity could be due to the effect of sedating medications including benzodiazepine or barbiturate or it can be seen in anxiety or hyperthyroidism.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  No seizures were captured during this recording.

MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The recording start time was 11:29 a.m.  The recording end time was 12 noon.  The recording length was 25 minutes.
As the record opens there is a well formed and symmetric 9-10 Hz  posterior dominant rhythm that is reactive to eye opening.  There is a small amount of frontal central beta activity that is symmetrically distributed.  Brief drowsiness is characterized by attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm.  At approximately 11:45 a.m., approximately 15 minutes into the recording epic, the patient complained of right hemibody tingling and numbness.  She was examined by the physician in the laboratory at the time, and there were no obvious clinical sequela.  During this time, there was no change in the background cerebral activity of the EEG.
Hyperventilation was performed for 3 minutes with good effort and failed to activate the tracing.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and induced a very reactive and responsive photic driving response at intermediate flash frequency ranges.  The patient's heart rate ranged from 70-90 beats during the record epic.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG capturing wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A normal EEG does no rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  The brief clinical event of right hemibody numbness and tingling were not associated with changes in the background cerebral activity.  Thus, this event is likely a nonepileptic event.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed at bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient is in a hard collar and isolation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates an asymmetry.  The activity from the right hemisphere includes a mixture of data with smaller amounts of delta in this awake patient.  There is abundant 6 Hz activity and a glimpse of an 8 Hz alpha rhythm. The activity is relatively attenuated on the left.  As the patient becomes drowsy, the right hemisphere transitions a bit more towards the delta pattern.  There is some sharp wave contoured theta noted in the right hemisphere, particularly at T2 and there was also some arrhythmic delta activity in the right posterior quadrant as the patient becomes drowsy.
Heart rate 96 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal electroencephalogram due to:
Intra-hemispheric asymmetry with relative attenuation of the activity on the left compared to the right.
Background slowing noted bilaterally, right greater than left.
There are some subtle sharp waves noted on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a structural or functional abnormality on the left and the attenuated pattern is relatively characteristic of a subdural hematoma.  The sharp waves noted are relatively subtle.  These findings should be correlated with imaging.  Overall, this electroencephalogram supports a bihemispheric process, impacting the left hemisphere more so than the right but a subdural hematoma can attenuate the EEG.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This was predominantly drowsiness and stage 1 sleep record with brief periods of wakefulness.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
MEDICATIONS:  Zonisamide, albuterol, Zyrtec.
TECHNICAL PROBLEMS:  The C3 CZ leads appear to have been closely placed because of which there is flattening of EEG in that channel.
HISTORY:  A 27-year-old lady who is mentally challenged, born out of complicated pregnancy, i.e. cesarean section and was born blue.  She was diagnosed with seizure disorder 1 year ago.  Per mother the patient has seizures every day with just eye twitching.  Also has left-sided twitching.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Periods of wakefulness were very brief as this was predominantly a sleep record.  In the brief period that the was awake there is diffuse slowing with a posterior dominant rhythm in the theta range with maximum frequency of 7 Hertz which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.
Sleep was characterized by diffuse slowing and some waves resembling vertex waves, but no definite vertex morphology was seen.  There were abnormal discharges seen during sleep which will be further described below under the section abnormal discharges.
Hypoventilation did not change the record significantly.
Photic stimulation did not elicit any abnormal discharges.

HISTORY:  A 62-year-old woman with past medical history of anxiety that has been having constant jerking episodes when falling asleep of her extremities, abdomen and face that lately have worsened in frequency and have become intolerable and do not permit her to go to sleep.  She is here for classification of these episodes, rule out seizures/myoclonus versus nonepileptic spells.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures produced no abnormal discharges.
The patient is recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Overall, the background appears to be normal.  However, as the patient becomes drowsy, intermittent muscle artifact jerks can be seen throughout the recording, at times the EMG artifact could be noted more over the left temporalis muscle than the right.  There appears to be no preceding cortical discharge prior to this muscle artifact.  The video does not reveal clear facial jerks although the technician reports that she noticed some facial jerking irregularly. At one point, the patient does have some abdominal flexion which occurs congruously or at the same time as the muscle artifact occurred. Again, none of these artifacts have a preceding cortical discharge that could be clearly seen.
SEIZURES:  None.
HEART RATE:  66.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and drowsy EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy EEG.  No seizures were seen.  Please note that the jerking episodes described above had no clear cortical or electrographic discharge and may be muscular discharges or possible myoclonus of subcortical origin.  No clear seizures were seen.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The patient seems to be drowsy throughout much of the EEG, but in wakefulness there is excess beta and excess theta in a somewhat poorly organized record.  In the sharply contoured background, there is prominent frontal beta and as the patient becomes drowsy there is some paroxysmal high amplitude bursts, but no definitive frontal sharp waves or spikes.
Hyperventilation seems to accentuate the background slowing and there is a very subtle focality with perhaps a bit more left-sided focal slowing in hyperventilation compared to the right.
Photic stimulation is remarkable for generous beta, but a driving response.  Heart rate is 60 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG in wakefulness and sleep due to:
Somewhat disorganized pattern for age.
Excess beta.
Excess theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The excess beta could be due to medication effect or anxiety.  The excess theta suggests a bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function.  It is important to have a complete list of this patient's medications.  No definitive sharp waves or spikes were seen.  A more prolonged study capturing sleep may be of value.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  The technologist noted that this patient seemed to have stable cognition throughout the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a low voltage 10 Hz alpha rhythm in the background with generous low voltage beta.  The patient seemed to be a bit drowsy, transitioning into stage I sleep with an increase in beta and in vertex waves followed by arousal.  Hyperventilation did not significantly active the record.  In fact, the patient seemed to be falling asleep at the end of hyperventilation with beta spindles characteristic of stage II sleep.  Other features of sleep included vertex waves and more subtle POSTS.  Sustained stage II sleep was more abundant in those vertex waves, K complexes, and POSTS were noted.
The patient remained drowsy throughout photic stimulation which nonetheless, elicited a driving response.  By the end of photic stimulation, she was drifting back into stage II sleep.
Heart rate 66 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal sleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  This patient appears to be extremely sleepy.  Clinical correlation for hypersomnolence may be appropriate, but a sleep-deprived EEG could also produce these findings.

INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with addition of T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the posterior dominant rhythm was 9-10 Hz in frequency seen in the occipital region, which attenuated with eye opening.  There was presence of low-amplitude frontocentral beta activity, which was distributed symmetrically.  There were occasional bursts of focal slowing in the left anterior and mid temporal region consisting of 2.5-3 Hz delta frequency lasting for 1-2 seconds.  Drowsiness was characterized by disappearance of the alpha rhythm, slowing of the background, and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact.  No epileptiform activity or seizures captured in this study.  Heart rate was 60 beats per minute and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG recording capturing wakefulness through drowsiness due to occasional bursts of focal slowing in the left anterior and mid temporal regions during wakefulness and drowsiness.  No epileptiform abnormalities were identified in this recording.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Focal slowing in the left hemisphere suggestive of a structural abnormality in the left hemisphere or left temporal dysfunction.  No epileptiform abnormalities or seizures were seen in this recording.  This does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy or of intermittent seizures.  If seizures are a clinical concern, a repeat sleep-deprived EEG or a 24-hour video EEG monitoring may be helpful.

INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with the additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state for the short period of time during this recording, the posterior dominant rhythm was 8.5-9 Hz in frequency  in the occipital region which attenuates with eye opening.  There is presence of generalized beta activity with symmetrical distribution.  Drowsiness, stage 1 and stage 2 sleep are predominant features of this recording and are characterized by disappearance of the posterior dominant rhythm, slowing of the background, and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact as well as the presence of vertex sharp waves, posts, K complexes, and sleep spindles.  This is a low amplitude EEG.  Hyperventilation results in no significant change in the background activity.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and results in no driving response.  Heart rate was at 80 beats per minute and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG recording capturing wakefulness for a short period of time through stage 2 sleep for most part of this recording.  No epileptiform abnormalities or seizures were identified in this recording.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Generalized beta activity could be due to medication effect including benzodiazepine, barbiturates, or could be due to anxiety or hyperthyroidism.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  No epileptiform abnormalities or seizures were seen in this recording.  This does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are of clinical concern, a repeat EEG when patient is more awake is recommended.

1908,"CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 70-year-old found unresponsive in her kitchen, suffered a generalized tonic-clonic seizure of 30 seconds' duration en route to hospital.  Eyes deviated to the right.  Past left MCA infarct.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Versed, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was relatively somnolent.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a pattern with diffuse beta and bursts of spindles.  In addition, there is arrhythmic delta activity and the beta drops out for a burst of arrhythmic delta activity.  The arrhythmic delta activity is somewhat more remarkable on the right, and there is subtle underlying sharply contoured slowing in the right posterior occipital region as well as a bit more attenuation of faster frequency activity on the right relative to the left.  Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in rhythmic theta.  As the recording continues, the background EEG is richer in both beta and theta.  The initial asymmetry is a bit less prominent.
Heart rate 72 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is a dynamic but abnormal EEG due to:
Initial markedly slow pattern with intermittent paroxysmal beta.
At the end of the record, the EEG remains quite slow, but there is an increase in beta and a decrease in the arrhythmic delta activity.
An asymmetry with a bit more arrhythmic delta activity in the right posterior quadrant.
Some sharply contoured slowing in the right posterior quadrant.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The postictal state and the use of sedative hypnotic medications may play a role in the marked background slowing and the beta in this record.  No seizures were recorded.  The arrhythmic delta activity may be correlated with imaging.  If seizures are an important consideration, a repeat tracing is suggested, given the sharply contoured slowing described above.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 51-year-old woman with a grand mal seizure December 2012 characterized by eyes rolling back, foaming at the mouth.  The patient's most recent seizure was 1 week ago.



MEDICATIONS:  Trileptal, Xanax, Elavil, doxepin.



INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and asleep record.



TECHNICAL ISSUES:  Impedances were satisfactory, but there is a fair amount of muscle artifact and the patient seemed jittery while awake.



DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In relaxed wakefulness, the alpha rhythm is a bit slower at 7.5 Hz but with stimulation it reaches 10 Hz.  It is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  Generous beta was noted in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Wicket was noted as the patient transitioned into sleep.  Photic stimulation elicited a bilateral driving response.



Hyperventilation produced a small amount of slowing.



Heart rate 72 beats per minute.



IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and drowsiness.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  The excess beta may be due to this patient's medications.  The excess muscle may be associated with shivering in this cold environment or nervousness.

Seizures characterized by blank stares and a metallic taste and then waking up confused.  Over the last 2 weeks, he has had increasing drop attacks, followed by head turning to the right, shaking tongue and body, and tonic-clonic seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low-voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  The patient rapidly transitions in between wakefulness and stage 2 sleep.  Features of stage 2 sleep include vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and posts.
Hyperventilation does not activate the record.
At the closing of the record, head rocking artifact was noted in the right occipital scalp region.
Photic stimulation was not performed.

MEDICATIONS:  Vimpat, Keppra, benzodiazepines, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing began, the patient is in ICU and is very confused and moving about.  The background EEG is markedly abnormal with primarily a theta pattern, poorly organized with generous background beta.  In addition, there are sharp waves noted in the record with more than one localization including C3 and the right temporal region.  There is prominent theta noted in the background.
A burst of right temporal sharp waves and delta was noted at 2:35 but without a clear clinical correlate.  This burst continues as might be anticipated in an electrographic seizure but looking at the video the patient does not appear to be doing anything other than motion arrest.  There is no significant change in the patient's behavior after this 30-second discharge.  Additional bursts of right temporal sharp waves and spikes maximum in the anterior temporal region were noted at 2:47.  At the close of the EEG, the right temporal sharp waves are building up.  They have not yet evolved into the pattern of a seizure.  Of note, the patient has turned his head to the left but testing is not performed and it is difficult to determine if there is really a change in the patient's mental status.  The patient is confused but interactive throughout the EEG.
Heart rate 90 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to:
Marked background slowing and disorganization.
Prominent right anterior temporal sharp waves and spikes.
At least 1 electrographic seizure from the right temporal region.
Sharp waves noted on occasion from the left hemisphere as well.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In this individual who has had recent, repetitive seizures, this is an ongoing ictal record although it does not meet the formal criteria for a status epilepticus record and the seizure that was recorded appeared to be with little clinical signs or symptoms and was brief.
Additional EEG recording was initiated on the evening of the 16th.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 78-year-old woman with dementia, atrial fibrillation and GERD who presents with 3 days of right upper extremity shaking.
MEDICATIONS:  Fentanyl, Ativan.
INTRODUCTION:  A long-term EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded while minimally responsive.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Continuous spike wave detection as well as seizure detection software along with the patient's events and notes were used to review the EEG.
Technical difficulties:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontal central beta.  Overall there is some intermittent spindle frequency bursts seen intermittently and some intermittent arterial vascular movements seen throughout the recording.  The patient was stimulated with suctioning.  There appears to be no variability or increased frequency in the EEG.
Heart rate:  72.
Abnormal discharges:  Generalized slow waves and decreased amplitude at 2-4 Hz seen throughout the recording.
Seizures:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to generalized slowing and diffuse oppression.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology, however, the intermittent spindles suggest that it is at least in part due to medication effect.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
HEART RATE:  60.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness, stage I and stage II sleep.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produce no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow wave seen intermittently at T3 as well as T4 at frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
There is a single sharp transient seen at T4 throughout the recording.
Seizures none.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to bilateral independent mid temporal focal slowing in addition to a sharp transient.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the bilateral mid temporal region, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  In addition, there is a single sharp transient in the right mid temporal region, its significance is unclear and it may reflect irritability in that region of the brain.  However, a prolonged recording capturing deeper stages of sleep for a longer period may help in clarifying the significance of this discharge.

Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements, anterior spread of the alpha rhythm, and increase in beta followed by theta with rare vertex waves.  The patient was transitioned into stage 2 sleep with vertex waves and spindles during photic stimulation.  Despite this, a driving response was elicited.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in theta.
IMPRESSION:  This is a mildly abnormal EEG in wakefulness through stage 2 sleep due to
Slight slowing of the alpha rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  The mild slowing of the alpha rhythm is a nonspecific finding.  It may be a part of postictal state or other diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a followup study may be of value.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and briefly drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates an appropriate pattern for a young adult of this age with a 10 Hz alpha rhythm reaching 90 mV.  The alpha rhythm is sometimes a little higher amplitude on the left compared to the right.
Features of drowsiness include anterior spread of the alpha rhythm. Deeper stages of sleep were not sustained.  Posterior slow waves of youth were noted in wakefulness.  Although deeper stages of sleep were not achieved, just as the patient was becoming drowsy there seems to be some subtle underlying 4-5 Hz theta in the left occipital region.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  There is no T1 and T2 electrodes due to his skull defect.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  In the sedated state, there is diffuse slowing of the background consisting of delta activity, 2-3 Hz frequency, most pronounced on the left side.  There is intermittent alpha activity with a frequency of 8-9 Hz, lasting for 1-2 seconds, most pronounced in frontotemporal region.  There is hemispheric asymmetry characterized by higher amplitude in left hemispheric regions, most pronounced in the frontotemporal areas.  There is slowing of the background activity in delta range with a frequency of 2-3 Hz almost continuously.  There is spontaneous variability seen with increase in background frequency.  There is also reactivity to stimulation.  There is no epileptiform activity or clinical seizures noted during this recording.  Heart rate was 100 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Diffuse slowing of the background activity in delta and theta range intermixed with intermittent alpha activity.
Focal slowing and breach in left cerebral hemisphere, most pronounced in frontotemporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The above findings are suggestive of metabolic, toxic, hypoxic, or infectious encephalopathy or due to the effect of sedating medications.  Left focal slowing is indicative of focal structural dysfunction in the left cerebral hemisphere, most pronounced in frontotemporal region.  Breach rhythm is consistent with a history of left craniectomy.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.  This does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy or of intermittent seizures.

There is no loss of consciousness or urinary incontinence.  Past medical history is significant for hypertension, coronary artery disease, CHF, hyperlipidemia, and stroke with right-sided weakness.
MEDICATIONS:  Metoprolol, aspirin, Plavix, Keppra, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the posterior dominant rhythm was 7-8 Hz in frequency seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is 6-7 Hz diffuse theta activity seen during wakefulness, which is distributed symmetrically.  There is a small amount of low amplitude, frontocentral beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  Drowsiness is characterized by disappearance of the posterior dominant rhythm and slowing of the background and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact.  There were occasional burst of left anterior and mid temporal slowing at F7/T3, during wakefulness consisting of 4-5 Hz activity.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and results in no driving response.  Heart rate was 60 beats per minutes and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Diffuse slowing of the background with theta activity seen in wakefulness and slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm.
Left focal temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Diffuse slowing could be due to metabolic, toxic, hypoxic, or infectious encephalopathy.  Alternatively, it could be due to the effect of sedating medications or bilateral cerebral dysfunction or degenerative brain disease.  Focal slowing is suggestive of a structural abnormality in the left hemisphere or left temporal dysfunction.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  No epileptiform abnormalities or seizures were captured.  This does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy or intermittent seizures.  If clinically indicated, a repeat EEG capturing deeper stages of sleep or continuous bedside EEG monitoring may be helpful.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the posterior dominant rhythm was 8.5 to 9 Hz performed in the right occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is hemispheric asymmetry, which is characterized by left hemispheric attenuation and slowing with loss of faster frequencies.  There is also almost continuous left temporal delta activity maximal at T3/T1 during this recording.  There are occasional sharp wave discharges noted at T3/C3/T5 with no evolution or electrographic seizures.  There is excess theta activity during wakefulness.  Stage I and stage II sleep were characterized by disappearance of the posterior dominant rhythm, slowing of the background, and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact, as well as the presence of vertex sharp waves and posts and also K complexes and sleep spindles.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and results in an asymmetric driving response, most pronounced on the right side.  Heart rate was 60 and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to;
Left hemispheric asymmetry characterized by slowing, attenuation, and loss of faster frequencies.
Almost continuous left temporal delta activity, maximal at T3 and T1.
Occasional sharp wave discharges noted at C3/T3/T5.
Excess theta activity during wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Left hemispheric asymmetry characterized by loss of faster frequencies and attenuation could be due to a history of left MCA ischemic stroke.  Continuous left temporal delta activity in left temporal region could be due to structural abnormalities in the left temporal area or left temporal dysfunction.  The sharp wave discharges in left parietal, central, and temporal region are indicative of irritability of cerebral cortex in this area and place this patient at higher risk for partial seizures.  Diffuse excess theta activity is suggestive of toxic, metabolic, degenerative, infectious, or ischemic encephalopathy.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  There were no electrographic seizures or clinical seizures noted during this recording.

Activating procedures were not performed.  Continuous spike wave detection as well as seizure detection software as well as patient notes and nurse's notes and patient alarms were used to review the EEG.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  Overall, the recording appears to be mainly in the delta frequencies with some intermittent faster frequencies showing up periodically.  There are some stage changes noted.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal sharp waves seen continuously at T5/P3 with a periodicity that ranges from 0.5 Hz to 2 Hz, at times becoming slightly less organized.  These are consistent with periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs).
Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-40 mV.
SEIZURES:  Although there were about 2-3 rhythmic runs of the PLEDs, there were 2 electrographic seizures.  One occurred at 4:15 p.m. lasting for a minute and a half.  The 2nd one occurred at 9:43 p.m.  Both of them did not appear to have any clear clinical correlate.  They were comprised of rhythmic P3-4/T5 sharp waves, evolving in frequency and amplitude and then suddenly stopping.
HEART RATE:  84.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left posterior temporal and parietal periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) and electrographic seizures in addition to generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals left posterior temporal and parietal seizures as well as a focus of irritability and cerebral dysfunction in that region.  This is likely related to the known lesion in that region.  In addition, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral  dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology and may be due at least in part to medication effect.

There is a small amount of low amplitude frontal central beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  The background activity is characterized by delta activity with a frequency of 1.8-2.5 Hz frontally predominant delta activity intermixed with 5-6 Hz theta activity.  There are intermittent bursts of frontal intermittent delta activity, (FIRDA) seen with a frequency of 1-1.2 Hz and amplitude of 50-70 microvolt lasting for 2-3 seconds. Photic stimulation and hyperventilation result in no responses. Heart rate was 60 beats per minute and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG recording due to the slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm and background activity and the presence of FIRDA bursts during wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The above findings could be due to metabolic encephalopathy, degenerative brain disease, increased intracranial pressure, or a deep midline lesion in the brain.  No epileptiform abnormalities are identified in this record. No seizures are captured.  This does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy or intermittent seizures.

1953,"CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 63-year-old man with a past history of a motor vehicle accident in 1970 with a subsequent coma.  The patient developed post traumatic epilepsy and has had recent seizures.  His highest seizure frequency has been as high as 10 seizures per day.
MEDICATIONS: None
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed on this patient using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG monitoring.  During the course of the recording hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  The recording captures wakefulness through stage 1 and stage 2 sleep.
Recording was 22minutes in duration.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the record opens there is a symmetric 8.5 to 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm that is reactive to eye opening.  There is a small amount of frontocentral beta activity that is present as well.  Drowsiness is characterized by a decrease in eye blinks and the appearance of slowing in the theta range in the occipital electrodes.  There is the appearance of slow rolling eye movements.  Throughout the recording there is intermittent focal slowing noted over the right hemisphere.  This is most prominent over the right frontotemporal region, but also extends into the frontocentral regions.  On several occasions throughout the recording there are medium amplitude sharp waves identified that are maximal in the right frontal region phase reversing at F8 and T4.  These occur as isolated sharp waves.  Hyperventilation induces generalized slowing in the tracing.  Photic stimulation does not induce a significant photic driving response.  There were no clinical events recorded or noted by the technician during the recording epoch.  There were no electrographic seizures identified. Heart rate varied from 60-80.
IMPRESSION:  In summary, this is an abnormal EEG capturing wakefulness through stage 2 sleep due to the presence of focal slowing over the right hemisphere and rare sharp waves noted over the right frontotemporal region.  The appearance of focal slowing may be suggestive of a structural brain lesion in this region.  Sharp waves have epileptiform potential.

MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed  using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the record opens there is a well formed medium to high amplitude 11 Hz posterior dominant rhythm that is briskly reactive to eye opening.  There is a small amount of frontal central beta activity identified which is symmetrically distributed.
During stage 1 sleep there is attenuation of the existing posterior dominant rhythm and the appearance of 5-6 Hz theta activity.  There is also a decrease in eye blinks and the appearance of slow rolling eye movements.  Stage 2 sleep is heralded by vertex waves and 14 Hz central sleep spindles.
Hyperventilation was performed for 3 minutes with good effort and failed to activate the tracing.
Photic stimulation is performed at intermediate and high flash frequency ranges and induces a symmetric photic driving response at intermediate flash frequency ranges.
There were no spikes or sharp waves detected.  There were no electrographic seizures detected.  Of note, the clinically described episodes of visual or auditory hallucinations were not captured during this recording EPOC.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG capturing wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A normal EEG does not rule out the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  If clinically indicated long term monitoring, either inpatient or outpatient, may be indicated in this patient.

INTRODUCTION:  __________
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the record opens, there is a well-formed and symmetric 9 to 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm that is reactive to eye opening.  There is a small amount of frontocentral beta activity identified which is symmetrically distributed.  Stage 1 sleep is characterized by attenuation and fragmentation of the existing posterior dominant rhythm and the appearance of central theta activity.  Stage 2 sleep is not appreciated.
On at least 4 occasions during the record, there is the appearance of spike and wave discharges.  On at least 2 of these occasions, the discharges appear generalized with a bifrontal maximum.  These appear during periods of light drowsiness.  For approximately 3 to 4 seconds, there is a disruption of the background and the appearance of bihemispheric slowing superimposed upon which there is a sharply contoured activity.  There is, however, a definitive bifrontal generalized spike.  Later in the recording, there is a similar brief background slowing, and there is again bifrontal generalized spike and wave discharges.  These discharges are singleton events and thus it is difficult to determine what their frequency is.  On the third appearance, the spike wave discharges appears predominantly over the left frontal region and is maximal at FT7.  This discharge has the appearance more consistent with a localized focal spike in the left frontal region.
Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation was performed in multiple flash frequencies and did not induce a significant photic driving response.  Of note, a photoparoxysmal response was not identified.  During the course of the recording, the heart rate varied between 70 and 90 beats.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG capturing wakefulness and drowsiness due to the presence of generalized bifrontal spike and wave discharges and a focal left frontal spike and wave discharge.
CLINICAL IMPRESSION:  The presence of bifrontal generalized spike-wave discharges may suggest an idiopathic generalized epilepsy in this patient.  The appearance of a focal spike in the left frontal region may suggest fragmentation of the generalized pattern during drowsiness but may also suggest the concomitant appearance of a generalized process plus a localized process, such as may be seen in __________ epilepsy or possibly in generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+).  Clinical correlation is advised.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation was not performed, but photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the record opens there is mild disorganization of the background with the appearance of central theta activity in the 5-7 Hz range superimposed on a posterior dominant rhythm that achieves only about 8 Hz.  The posterior dominant rhythm is reactive to eye opening, but throughout the recording it appears as though the patient is clinically either drowsy or falling asleep.  There is a small amount of frontal central beta activity identified.  Unfortunately, much of the tracing is obscured by muscle artifact from recurrent eye blinks and forehead and body movement.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using a standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the posterior dominant rhythm was 9.5-10 Hz in frequency seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is low amplitude diffuse beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  Drowsiness is characterized by disappearance of the alpha rhythm, slowing of the background, and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact.  Hyperventilation results in no change in background activity.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and results in a symmetric driving response.  Heart rate was 70 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG recording capturing wakefulness through drowsiness.  No epileptiform abnormalities were identified in this record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A normal EEG does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are clinical concern, a repeat EEG capturing at deeper stages of sleep or a 24-hour ambulatory EEG may be helpful.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In a lethargic state, the background activity is characterized by a generalized slowing in the delta and theta-frequency range. There is hemispheric asymmetry characterized by attenuation and slowing in right cerebral hemisphere. There is a excess theta activity well formed in left cerebral hemisphere.  There are intermittent delta activity, beta seen with a frequency of 1 to 1.2 Hz lasting for 2-3 seconds.  There are intermittent sharp waves arising from the left parietal-occipital regions most pronounced in P3 with field spread to C3 and O1, occasionally intermixed with the burst of left parieto-temporal slowing.  Heart rate was 70 to 80 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Diffuse slowing of the background activity.
Presence of theta burst.
Attenuation of the background activity in the right cerebral hemisphere.
Left parieto-occipital sharp wave discharges with no evolution, intermixed with temporoparietal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Diffuse slowing of the background activity could be due to toxic, metabolic, hypoxic, infectious encephalopathy.  Alternatively, it could be due to sedating medications or cerebral dysfunction or degenerative brain disease.  The theta burst could also be due to increased intracranial pressure, metabolic encephalopathy, or deep midline lesions in the brain.  Right hemispheric attenuation of the background could be due to right subdural hematoma.  The presence of intermittent sharp wave discharges in the left parieto-occipital region is suggestive of underlying epileptogenicity of that region and place this patient at higher risk for partial seizures.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm and frontocentral beta.  Overall, there are theta delta mixed frequencies intermingled with multiple multifocal spikes which I will describe in Abnormal Discharges.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Multifocal spikes seen at O1, O2, T6, Fp1, Fp2, T3, and P4.  However, the spikes are mainly seen at O1 and O2 and Fp1/Fp2.
Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts seen almost continuously throughout the recording.
SEIZURES:  During the record, there are multiple seizures which in the EEG appear to begin suddenly and display rhythmic, sharply contoured theta intermixed with beta that at times appears to be maximal frontally and then centrally with an overlying rhythmic occipital sharp focus.  The maximal focus or origin of the seizure is unclear.  It is also atypical as it does not appear to evolve as it suddenly starts, remains in the EEG at almost this irregular but continuous frequency, and then appears to slowly dissipate.  During these discharges, the patient appears to move her head side to side and sometimes moves her arms in a wild fashion.  On 1 occasion, her mouth appeared to twitch in the video.  The duration of these episodes can be anywhere from 1 or 2 minutes to prolonged 38-minute seizure.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to multiple seizures with unclear origin and multifocal spikes.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of multiple generalized seizures with unclear origin as well as multiple areas of irritability and structural dysfunction as well as diffuse dysfunction consistent with diagnosis of symptomatic generalized epilepsy.

1975,"CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is an 81-year-old male with fever and change of mental status.  No other clinical information available.
MEDICATIONS:  Cardizem, Reglan, vancomycin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was relatively somnolent.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a slow, mixed frequency pattern with theta and delta.  There are frontally predominant triphasic waves.  There are also some slow periodic complexes that appear in the right posterior quadrant more so than the left.  Stimulation of the patient produces a clear alerting response with a bit more fast theta frequency activity and a suggestion of a 6 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  When the patient drifts off to sleep, the EEG becomes more significantly slow with more rhythmic slow mixed theta delta.
Heart rate irregular 72 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
Marked background slowing.
Frontally predominant triphasic waves.
Occasional posteriorly predominant periodic complexes seen primarily on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Overall, this EEG is most suggestive of a toxic or metabolic pattern.  The triphasic waves improve with tactile stimulation and the patient shows a clear alerting with stimulation.  If seizures are an important consideration, additional EEG recording may be of value if this patient is thought to have seizures, particularly as  there is a right posterior periodic complex noted intermittently.

MEDICATIONS: Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best wakefulness reaches 6 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is no normal frontocentral beta.  Overall the patient is mainly recorded during sleep but during the limited wakefulness appears to be extensive theta.  No activating procedures were performed and clear staged changes were seen.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen at T4 intermittently at a frequency of 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-40 microvolts.
Generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts seen during wakefulness and at times with frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA).
SEIZURES:  None.
HEART RATE:  72.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to a right mid temporal focal slowing as well as generalized slowing of frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA).
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the right mid temporal region, which is consistent with a known hemorrhage.  In addition, there is evidence of moderate to diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology and may be due at least in part to medication effect.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.

MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Minor electrode problems were noted in the right temporal electrodes.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG includes an 8.7 hertz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements and occasional bursts of frontal delta.
Sleep was not sustained.
Hyperventilation was not feasible.  Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.
Heart rate was 78.

MEDICATIONS:  Insulin, aspirin, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation was not possible due to the patient's mental status, but photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates continuous focal slowing from the left hemisphere, some of which is sharply contoured with a phase reversal at T1.  There are T1 sharp waves noted intermittently.  The field of focal slowing is relatively diffuse throughout the left hemisphere, and there is disruption of the alpha rhythm.  In wakefulness, the right hemisphere demonstrates a well-formed alpha rhythm.
Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing.  Early stage I sleep was identified with limited vertex waves.  Of note, as the patient transitions to sleep, there is less in the way of rhythmic sharply contoured slowing.  Photic stimulation produces a driving response on the right but not the left.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to prominent, rhythmic slowing with sharp waves, really seen primarily in wakefulness on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There were no clear clinical correlates for the features described above.  There are brief transitions into stage II sleep for this individual, although sleep was not sustained, but the majority of the sharply contoured slowing and rhythmic slowing is seen in wakefulness.  Ongoing monitoring is essential.

Recently she has been having episodes of abnormal eye movements, followed by loss of consciousness that occur every 4 days.  She also has a history of generalized tonic clonic convulsions that were nocturnal, as well as panic attacks.  Past medical history is notable for bipolar disorder, insomnia, drug abuse, and fibromyalgia.
MEDICATIONS:  Mirtazapine, hydroxyzine, and inhalers.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Both hypoventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of polymorphic moderate amplitude 10.5-11 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening. There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  Both slow and fast alpha variant are captured.  Diffuse excess beta is observed.
During sleep symmetrical vertex waves, sleep spindles, K-complexes and POSTS (positive occipital sharp transient of sleep) are captured.
Hyperventilation is performed with good effort and produces mild diffuse background slowing.
Step photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.  No focal slowing or epileptiform discharges are captured.  A regular heart rate is noted on a single EKG lead.
FINDINGS:
Stage II sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
Excess beta.
Fast and slow alpha variant.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and sleep 25-minute EEG.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  Excess beta could be secondary to medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.

MEDICATIONS:  Decadron, Depakote, many others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This was a drowsy individual.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is slow and disorganized.  There is an asymmetry noted.  There is a bit more faster frequency activity noted in the left hemisphere, particularly in the left frontal region compared to the right.  With stimulation, there is an alerting response and an 8 Hz alpha rhythm is identified bilaterally.  As the patient drifted in and out of sleep, there was shifting in delta activity but the activity is a bit slower on the right compared to the left.
Features of drowsiness included an increase in background slowing.
Heart rate 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Shifting slowing with attenuation of some of the faster frequency activity on the right compared to the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The mass effect of this tumor may account for the mismatch in terms of the field of slowing in comparison to the MRI findings.  No epileptiform features were noted.  The bilateral background slowing suggests a diffuse process as may be seen in the context of increased intracranial pressure or mass effect.

2001,"CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 49-year-old male with left frontal encephalomalacia and past history of epilepsy, found down this morning seizing with refractory status epilepticus and temperature of 101.3.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan 4 mg, Versed drip 160 mg, propofol,  succinylcholine,  etomidate, Dilantin 1500 mg.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital EEG was performed in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient has been intubated and was somnolent.  Technical challenges for this EEG include problems with the electrical system utilized for the patient's hospital bed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is diffusely slow, low voltage, and relatively suppressed with slower, lower voltage delta, and scant amount of beta and alpha frequency activity.  Spontaneous arousals are associated with movement artifact.  The quantity of beta activity waxes and wanes in this record and in this low voltage record, shifting asymmetries were identified.
Stimulation of the patient as the recording continues clearly produces  an alerting response with eye opening and rolling eye movements are noted a little bit more prominently in later sections of the record.
Heart rate:  120 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to:
Replacement of normal background including low voltage, slow delta pattern.
Scant, frontal central fast activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In this patient with refractory status epilepticus, the current pattern is one of pharmacologic coma.  No epileptiform features were identified. Additional EEG recording was undertaken to make certain that no epileptiform features were overlooked.

MEDICATIONS:  Metoprolol.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the laboratory using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  Photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.
Despite the eye movement artifacts, as the patient transitions into drowsiness, there is occasional, focal slowing with beta noted in the left hemisphere, particularly frontotemporal frontocentral.
Photic stimulation elicited brief bilateral driving.
Heart rate 60 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is a mildly abnormal EEG due to focal slowing noted in drowsiness in the left frontocentral frontotemporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The findings described above are of unclear clinical significance.  They may be seen in the context of TIA or cerebrovascular ischemia.  No definitive epileptiform features were identified.  Because similar features can be seen in the context of a focal seizure, if needed, a repeat tracing capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.

2009,"CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 49-year-old male with first ever seizure 3 weeks ago, characterized by left leg twitching, left leg weakness and numbness.  Found to have right frontal parenchymal contusion and right subdural hematoma in November 2002.  Admitted on the 21st for numbness.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra and Lovenox.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This is an awake and drowsy record.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  There is prominent, frontal central beta.  In wakefulness an a bit more prominently in drowsiness, there is focal slowing from the right frontal central and central temporal regions.  This is primarily characterized by slower delta, but with some disruption in faster frequency activity.  Hyperventilation was performed early in the record, and accentuates the right frontal central focal slowing.  Features of drowsiness included increase in beta.  The intermittent right frontal central focal slowing persists.
Photic stimulation elicited harmonic and super harmonic driving.
Heart rate 78 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to focal slowing from the right frontal central region with occasional disruption of frequency activity in that area.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is most supportive of a structural or functional process in the right frontal central region.  No epileptiform features were identified.  As this patient recovers from the head injury, a follow-up study may be of value.

2010,"CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 27-year-old female with history of cognitive dysfunction secondary to cerebral anoxia.
MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the alpha rhythm is 9-10 Hz in frequency, seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude frontal central beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  Drowsiness was characterized by diffuse background slowing, shifting of the posterior dominant rhythm to anterior head regions and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact.  There are intermittent bursts of left anterior to mid temporal slowing, 1.5-3 Hz frequency lasting for 1-2 seconds during drowsiness and wakefulness.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and resulted in no driving response.  Heart rate was 80 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG recording capturing wakefulness through drowsiness due to the presence of intermittent left temporal slowing.  No epileptiform abnormalities or electrographic seizures were identified in this record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The above findings could be due to an underlying structural abnormality in the subcortical white matter of left hemispheres.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  No epileptiform abnormalities or electrographic seizures were seen in this record.  This does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If clinically indicated, a repeat sleep deprived EEG or a 24-hour ambulatory EEG may be helpful.

2011,"CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 31-year-old woman with epilepsy, seizure free for 15 years but with recurrent seizures 6 months ago.  The patient also had a recent seizure 6 days ago described as eyes rolling up with generalized shaking for 10 minutes and incontinence with tongue biting.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This was an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This is an unusual background.  Some sections of the record in wakefulness are well organized.  There is a 10 Hertz alpha rhythm.  In wakefulness there is intermittent, rhythmic, 4-6 Hertz theta activity.  In addition, there is irregular, left temporal theta as well as some rhythmic left temporal theta with sharp wave or sharply contoured slowing typically maximum at T3, occasionally T1.  Focal features were also noted from the right with occasional bursts of slowing on the right.  There is EKG artifacts but the sharply contoured slowing is more prominent on the left.
Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.  Heart 84 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal electroencephalogram due to:
Left temporal focal slowing.
Intermittent generalized slowing.
Independent, rhythmic slowing from the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG demonstrates a bi-hemispheric disturbance.  The mechanism for this patient's epilepsy, however, may be in the left temporal region.

2012,"CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 55-year-old male with chronic kidney disease, lupus, admitted in respiratory failure with atrial fibrillation now with intermittent jerking activity.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Ativan, fentanyl.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This was a technical difficult bedside record in a critically ill patient who was receiving treatments during the EEG and awaiting dialysis.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly slow but continuous and lacks the typical hallmarks of either an awake or asleep individual in this obtunded patient.  There is primarily rhythmic theta with some arrhythmic delta.  Although this is a technically challenging record with perhaps some attenuation in the electrodes in the right temporal region, there is an occasional right occipital temporal sharp wave noted in the background.  No clinical jerking of the extremities is seen with the jerking.  Finally, predominant triphasic waves were noted as was shifting slowing in this overall slow record.  Intermittent attenuations were noted.
Towards the close of the record, intermittent jerking was noted.  On some occasions this was associated with movement artifact, on other occasions attenuation and on other occasions the jerkiness is associated with an overall attenuation of the background.
Heart rate:  120 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to:
Replacement of normal background with primarily a theta frequency background.
Shifting slowing.
Triphasic waves.
A right occipital sharp wave.
Intermittent attenuation of the background which was sometimes associated with jerking of the body or limbs.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptic seizures were identified.  Overall, the pattern described above is one more commonly seen in the context of metabolic encephalopathy as described above.

2013,"LENGTH OF RECORDING:  26 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 59-year-old gentleman with a history of schizophrenia who presents with altered mental status and at least 2 episodes of tonic posturing with decreased responsiveness in the setting of ingesting Vicks VapoRub.
MEDICATIONS:  Lovenox, Ativan 1 mg at 6:00 a.m. and several mgs on 01/13/2013.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrode with a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  There is right-to-left interhemispheric asymmetry with slower wave forms observed over the left hemisphere.  The background consists of a mixture of diffuse beta, theta, and delta activity.  Additional polymorphic often sharply contoured delta is observed over the left hemisphere, primarily over the left temporal region.  Several electrographic seizures are captured in this recording.  Seizures have abrupt onset without clear localization or lateralization.  Electrographically diffuse EMG artifact is observed.  Once the EMG artifact resolves generalized sharply contoured approximately 3 Hz rhythmic delta activity is observed diffusely, but it is higher in amplitude over the left hemisphere.  This activity increases in amplitude and decreases in frequency to approximately 2 Hz and often evolves into another episode of generalized EMG artifact that obscures the recording.  Once that EMG artifact resolves, rhythmic sharply contoured 3-4 Hz delta activity is often observed over the left temple region.
Clinically it appears that the patient moans and slobbers at the onset of seizure and has decreased responsiveness during the seizure.
FINDINGS:
Focal status epilepticus.
Excess beta.
Left hemispheric slowing most pronounced over the left temporal region.
Mild to moderate diffuse slowing.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal 26-minute electroencephalogram due to diffuse slowing, focal left hemispheric slowing that is most pronounced over the left temporal region and multiple focal left temporal electrographic seizures without returning back to baseline.  Diffuse background slowing indicates etiologically nonspecific diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Focal left hemispheric slowing that is most pronounced over the temporal region indicates focal cerebral dysfunction, and in this case, could partially be to related post-ictal phenomenon.  Multiple electrographic and clinical seizures captured during the recording are consistent with focal status epilepticus.  These findings were conveyed to the Neurology consult team at the time of the recording.

2014,"LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  27 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 54-year-old man who presents with chief complaint of dizzy spells.  Of note, there is a past medical history of generalized convulsions and falling.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of well formed and modulated 9 to 10 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There are anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During sleep, posterior dominant rhythm attenuates,  vertex waves and sleep spindles are captured.  Hyperventilation produces mild diffuse symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.
FINDINGS:
No epileptiform discharges.
Stage II sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and asleep 27-minute EEG.  The lack of epileptiform discharges in a routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.

2015,"CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 44-year-old male with factor V deficiency, hypertension, DVT, and coronary artery disease as well as epilepsy.  The patient developed chest pain and 3 seizures on the 3rd, characterized by generalized, upper extremity movements.
MEDICATIONS:  Zocor, Plavix, aspirin, Keppra, Dilantin, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient appears to be drowsy.  In addition, there is some head rocking movement on the right.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The drowsy record is relatively symmetric with generous beta.  TOSTs are noted with occasional spindles in sleep.  Despite the head rocking artifact, there does appear to be some focal slowing and a discreet sharp wave in the right posterior temporal region.  Other sections of the record demonstrate more symmetric TOSTs in sleep.
Stimulation of the patient produced a brief arousal with an increase in alpha frequency activity but wakefulness was not sustained.
Heart rate 96 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a primarily drowsy EEG and is somewhat technically limited by head rocking artifact but is abnormal due to:
Right posterior temporal focal slowing.
Rare right posterior sharp waves.
No seizures were recorded.  Overall, much of the sleep morphology is symmetric.  In this individual with focal features, additional testing to look for an asymmetric alpha rhythm might be of value.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 51-year-old woman with a history of metastatic breast cancer who now presents with subacute change in mental status in the setting of fevers.  EEG is performed to rule out clinical seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Keppra, and antibiotics.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrode.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  A single EKG lead was used, as well.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  There is right to left interhemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms at lower amplitudes over the left hemisphere.  The background consists of polymorphic low to moderate amplitude, mixture of theta and delta activity and abundant triphasic wave forms while the patient is awake.  By the end of the recording, the patient appears asleep; however, no normal sleep architecture is captured.  There are no clear epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures.
FINDINGS:
Moderate diffuse slowing.
Focal left hemispheric slowing and voltage attenuation.
Abundant triphasic wave forms.
No electrographic seizures.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal 2-hour continuous video EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing, focal left hemispheric slowing at lower voltages, and abundant triphasic wave forms.  These findings indicate nonspecific cerebral dysfunction that is moderate in degree and at least partially related to toxic metabolic disturbances.  Focal slowing an attenuation over the left hemisphere indicates left hemispheric dysfunction that could be structural in etiology.  Triphasic wave forms are seen in nonspecific encephalopathy.  There were no clear electrographic seizures.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 33-year-old woman with 2 year history of spells of unclear etiology.  The spells are associated with initial metallic taste in her mouth and an overwhelming sensation of burning followed by loss of consciousness and generalized shaking with associated tongue biting and urinary incontinence as well as postictal confusion.  These events can last up to an hour.  The last such event was on 01/15/2013.
MEDICATIONS:  Current medications include Depakote, Klonopin and others.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with addition T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of  well-formed and modulated 9-10 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies with lower amplitudes anteriorly.  Diffuse excess beta is observed throughout the recording.  During drowsiness the posterior dominant rhythm attenuates and bursts of diffuse theta are captured.  Hyperventilation is performed with fair effort and produces no change in the background. Stepped photic stimulation results in no additionally abnormalities.
FINDINGS:
No epileptiform discharges.
Excess beta.
No stage II sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy 22 minute EEG.  No epileptiform discharges were captured, however, stage II sleep was not recorded.  If clinical indication for seizures persist, a repeat study with sleep maybe of benefit.  The excess beta could be secondary to medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.

2020,"CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 57-year-old woman with an episode of memory loss on January 5 lasting 30 minutes.  She had an amnestic spell while in a bank.  Since this time she has had intermittent right eye twitching.
MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with an 11 Hz alpha rhythm.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements and an increase in beta.
Brief stage 2 sleep includes  vertex waves and K-complexes and POSTS.  The patient was falling asleep during photic stimulation, but a driving response was elicited.
Heart rate:  60 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG in wakefulness and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Generous beta activity is noted, and there is a suggestion of an   alpha supra-harmonic.  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  The beta activity described above can be seen in the context of anxiety, but an alpha supra-harmonic could also account for this.  The frequent eye blinking is sometimes a sign of nervousness.

INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during lethargy.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Spike wave detection, seizure detection software, patient events and nurses notes were all used to review the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  There is no normal sleep architecture.  No activating procedures were performed.  Overall, the background consists of mainly delta frequency at 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-40 microvolts seen diffusely with intermittent bursts of theta.  Sometimes the patient arouses and there is some diffuse muscle artifact seen.  In addition, there is frequent triphasic waves which appear to be bifrontal predominant symmetric at times seen more rhythmically at 1 Hz.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Generalized slow waves described above and triphasics.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to moderate to severe generalized slowing in addition to triphasic waves.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm reaching 50 microvolts with 10 Hz low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Frequent muscle artifact was noted.  Very brief drowsiness was characterized by a decrease in muscle artifact, attenuation of the alpha rhythm, and an increase in theta.  Rare lambda was noted in wakefulness with rare POSTS noted in sleep.  Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.
Heart rate:  96 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG in wakefulness and brief drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.

INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while obtunded.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  There is no normal sleep architecture.  No activating procedures were performed.  Overall the background consists of diffuse slowing with attenuation of frequencies over the entire left hemisphere and focal slowing seen maximal in the left frontal region.  Over the right hemisphere, there is mainly theta/delta frequency at 2-4 Hz, amplitude of 20-60 microvolts, and at times faster in theta.  There appears to be no reactivity to the EEG with stimulation.  At times over the right hemisphere, there are some sharply contoured waveforms at T6 and T4.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Left hemisphere attenuation and focal slowing maximal over the frontal region.
Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz, amplitude of 20-40 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
HEART RATE: 108, rhythmic.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left hemispheric attenuation and focal slowing maximal in the frontal region as well as generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal structural cerebral dysfunction in the left hemisphere, maximal in the frontal region, involving both gray and white matter, which is consistent with the known stroke and hemorrhage.  In addition, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or clear epileptiform discharges were seen.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well formed and modulated moderate amplitude 10-1/2 to 11 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During sleep, POSTS (positive occipital sharp transients of sleep), symmetrical vertex waves, sleep spindles, and K-complexes are captured.  Hyperventilation produces mild symmetrical diffuse background slowing.  Step photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving at high frequency flash frequencies.  A regular heart rate is captured on the single EKG lead.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 58-year-old man who was found down on the floor unresponsive with a finger stick of 25.
MEDICATIONS:  Lisinopril, Zosyn, vancomycin, sildenafil.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed at patient's bedside.  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1/T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The background consists of periods of diffuse voltage attenuation lasting from several seconds to approximately 12-15 seconds, followed by progressive onset of bifrontal slow delta activity that increases in frequency and amplitude and spreads diffusely.  These episodes occur throughout the recording.  When the patient is stimulated diffuse voltage attenuation was achieved.  Due to the recurrent nature of these episodes, I suspect that these represent recurrent seizures.  No abnormal sleep architecture is captured.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
FINDINGS:  Status epilepticus.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal 21-minute EEG due to suspected status epilepticus involving bifrontal regions.  However, at least on several occasions, during the recording this discrete EEG pattern could be elicited by stimulation.  Therefore, it is also possible that these episodes represent forms of reactivity.  The findings were communicated to the neurology consult team.

2080,"CLINICAL HISTORY:  Elderly woman with severe heart failure, advanced dementia and recurrent syncopal spells.
MEDICATIONS:  Carvedilol, Lovenox, atorvastatin, hydralazine.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.  The patient was confused.
TECHNICAL:  This was a technically acceptable EEG with a small amount of muscle.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background is diffusely slow with an alpha rhythm of approximately 8 Hz.  There is intermittent, underlying arrhythmic delta activity with an asymmetry, a somewhat lower voltage record on the left in comparison to the right.  In addition, rhythmic delta on the left is sometimes more sustained than that seen on the right.
Photic stimulation elicits scant driving at intermediate flash frequencies.
Heart rate:  96 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Shifting asymmetries with a decrease in amplitude on the left.
Frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA).
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted.  The findings described above are nonspecific and can be seen as a postictal pattern.  They may also be seen in an individual with advanced dementia.  The asymmetries described above may be correlated with imaging.  No epileptiform features were noted.

2081,"CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 25-year-old with migraine headaches characterized by blurry vision, slurred speech, nausea, sensitivity to pain and left frontotemporal headache.
MEDICATIONS:  Topiramate.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with symmetric reactive 10.5 alpha rhythm and a small amount of low-voltage, frontocentral beta.  Lambda was noted in wakefulness.  As the patient became drowsy, attenuation of alpha rhythm was noted with more of a theta pattern and POSTS.  The patient transitions in and out of deeper stages of sleep with small epochs of stage II sleep followed by arousal.
Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background.  Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.
Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage II sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  Lambda waves are a normal finding.  This patient seemed to have somewhat fragmented sleep which may be related to underlying physical discomfort or an inability to get comfortable in the lab.

MEDICATIONS:  Risperdal, Advair, aspirin, Epzicom, Prezista and Viread.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is appropriately organized with a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  Central MU activity was noted, but testing was not performed to confirm this.  Hyperventilation was performed early in the record, producing some shifting slowing.   As hyperventilation continued, a burst of high amplitude rhythmic slowing from the left frontal region was identified.  No clinical correlates were noted.  This discharge was approximately 19 seconds in duration.  Of note, the burst of rhythmic slowing on the left seems to end over about 5 seconds and then a relatively normal awake pattern was noted.
In relaxed wakefulness, there is a mild degree of background slowing and as the patient transitions to drowsiness, there is very subtle underlying delta in the left hemisphere compared to the right.
Deeper stages of sleep were not achieved.
Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was awake.  Although there was a driving response, the photic stimulation seems to accentuate some underlying focal slowing at T5.
Heart rate:  66 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Mild background disorganization in wakefulness.
Subtle focal slowing from the left.
Left posterior temporal slowing in photic.
Electrographic left hemisphere seizure in hyperventilation without clinical correlate.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a focal mechanism for seizures for this patient. Given the electrographic seizure identified above, the patient's referring neurologist will be contacted so that additional management may be implemented.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 42-year-old woman who presents with episodes of losing time for the last 2 months or so.  The patient's companion reports that she also appears to have fluctuating mental status in the last several days.  Of note, yesterday the patient was found to have renal dysfunction.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Notable for drug abuse, hepatitis, and migraines.
MEDICATIONS:  Methadone, Wellbutrin, gabapentin, Vistaril, Risperdal, Topamax, albuterol, and Advair.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of polymorphic 9-10 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  The posterior dominant rhythm is stable.  There is an anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient that at times is weak as well.  Additionally, diffuse polymorphic theta, occasional delta, and FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity) are captured.  Occasional triphasic wave forms with anterior-to-posterior lag are noted.  Hyperventilation was performed with fair effort and does not result in significant change in the background.  Stepped photic stimulation does not result in additional abnormalities.  A single sharp transient is noted over the right mid temporal region.  Sleep is captured and characterized by attenuation of the posterior dominant rhythm and bursts of delta and theta activity as well as some FIRDA-like wave forms.
FINDINGS:
Mild diffuse slowing.
FIRDA.
Triphasic wave forms.
Right temporal sharp transient.
No electrographic seizures.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal awake and drowsy 29-minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing and triphasic wave forms.  These findings indicate etiological and nonspecific mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, possibly toxic metabolic in etiology.  Triphasic wave forms are seen in various forms of encephalopathy.  FIRDA is seen in encephalopathy.  Increased intracranial pressure and deep white matter lesions.  A single sharp transient seen over the right temporal region is of unclear clinical significance.  The lack of epileptiform discharges does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.

MEDICATIONS:  Versed, Keppra, fentanyl, magnesium, and many others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was intubated and poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a diffusely slow pattern with a mixture of delta and theta.  There is an overlying asymmetry with a breach rhythm on the left, congruent with the patient's past history of subdural hematoma and craniotomy.  Rare left temporal sharp waves were noted.
Heart rate 108 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Shifting slowing.
Occasional asymmetry with greater delta on the left.
Rare simple left temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were recorded.  The sharp waves were in the region of the patient's craniotomy.  This patient's medications and critical illness as well
as her past neurological history may all contribute to the pattern described above.  No seizures were recorded.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was very uncomfortable and had difficulty tolerating the electrodes.  Impedances were more challenging as the result.
TECHNICAL:  Impedance issues, patient cooperation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This bedside EEG demonstrates an asymmetry.  The right hemisphere is composed primarily of arrhythmic delta as well as some theta and smaller amounts of beta.  The left hemisphere on occasion includes some 7 Hz activity.  There is sharply-contoured slowing, some periodic slowing and even some sharp waves noted in the left hemisphere with variable maximum but more typically occipital or posterotemporal in nature.  On occasion, there is an alerting with a glimpse of an alpha rhythm on the left.
Heart rate 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to:
Intrahemispheric asymmetry with marked slowing on the right and disruption of faster-frequency activity.
Irregular slowing on the left with periodic slowing and occasional sharp waves in the left posterotemporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were recorded.  The markedly slow pattern on the right with disruption of faster-frequency activity and arrhythmic delta activity is supportive of a process in the right involving gray and white matter.  The left
hemisphere is also slow and disorganized, with some sharp waves.  These findings may be correlated with a previous stroke on the left.  No seizures were identified.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was noted to have a prominent right craniotomy.
TECHNICAL:  There is some muscle artifact, but overall this is a technically satisfactory record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing begins, the EEG is remarkable for a mixture of arrhythmic mixed theta-delta from the right hemisphere.  The left hemisphere has more of a medium amplitude more rhythmic theta pattern.  Although the patient is awake and following commands, an alpha rhythm was not identified.  As the patient drifts off to sleep, more of a rhythmic theta pattern is noted on the left with a mixture of arrhythmic delta and theta on the right.  Asymmetric spindles were noted out of the right central region.  In the context of a breech rhythm, there is some very subtle right frontocentral sharp waves noted.
The patient transitions in and out of stage II sleep with spindle activity.
Heart rate 50 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Continuous focal slowing on the right.
Background slowing on the left.
Rare discrete right frontal sharp waves.
FIRDA noted at the close of the record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a structural process on the right.  There are some subtle sharp waves noted in the region of the craniotomy on the right.  The bilateral background slowing suggests a bihemispheric process and may be part of this patient's postoperative pattern.  Correlation with imaging and clinical history is suggested.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
TECHNICAL:  The patient appears to be somewhat tense.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm.  During much of the EEG, there is a little bit more relaxed wakefulness with slowing of the alpha rhythm to 8.5 Hz.  Drowsiness was characterized by an increase in beta.  Other features of drowsiness include rhythmic mid temporal theta of drowsiness with vertex waves noted in stage I sleep.
During hyperventilation and in relaxed wakefulness, there are 2 simple sharp waves.  During hyperventilation the simple sharp waves are more clearly defined after going slow wave.
Photic stimulation was remarkable for prominent beta and prominent, supraharmonic driving.
Additionally, hyperventilation was remarkable for a fair amount of muscle artifact.
Heart rate 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is within limits of normal.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG demonstrated multiple, normal variants, some of which have the morphology of benign epileptiform discharges.  There is a single left mid to posterior temporal sharp wave.  In that there is only one discharge, this must be considered artifactual.  The generous beta described above may be due to this patient's medications.

Other features with drowsiness include rhythmic central theta.  The electrode artifact did not drop out in stage I sleep with vertex waves.  Brief stage II sleep included vertex waves with spindles.
Hyperventilation did not activate the record.  Photic stimulation was remarkable for a great deal of muscle artifact.  Heart rate 90 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a technically challenging but otherwise normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The wicket is a normal finding.  Given the degree of muscle artifact described above, a follow-up study capturing perhaps more prolonged
sleep or with other mechanisms to alleviate the muscle artifact is suggested.  Alternatively, comparison with this individual's childhood EEGs may be of value.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement and one channel of EKG.  Wakefulness was recorded during the EEG.  Activating procedures include hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL PROBLEMS:  There was continuous eye movement artifact in the first half of the recording, which impedes correct evaluation of the cerebral activity in the frontal leads.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz frequency, 30-50 microvolts in amplitude, which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  There is excess theta noted in the frontal leads in the section without the eye movement artifact.
Sleep was not achieved during the recording.
Hyperventilation was performed, which did not bring about significant change in the recording.
Photic stimulation did not elicit any changes in the record.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Occasional T3 focal slow waves at 2-4 Hz in frequency and 50-70 microvolts in amplitude.
Mildly excess theta in the frontal leads.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Left mid temporal intermittent slowing.
Mildly excess theta in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is suggestive of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left mid temporal region which is non-specific with regards to etiology.  The excess theta in the frontal leads may indicate drowsiness or a mild diffuse encephalopathy.

MEDICATIONS:  Trileptal, Celexa.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, alpha rhythm is 9.5-10 Hz in frequency seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude, frontocentral beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  Drowsiness is characterized by disappearance of the alpha rhythms, slowing of the background, and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact.  Hyperventilation results in symmetrical slowing of the background.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and results in a symmetric driving response.  Heart rate is 70 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG recording capturing wakefulness through drowsiness.  No epileptiform abnormalities were identified in this record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A normal EEG does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are a clinical concern, a repeat EEG capturing deeper stages of sleep or a 24-hour ambulatory EEG may be helpful.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system with one channel EKG.  The patient was awake.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates an asymmetric pattern.  The right hemisphere is low voltage, with a mixture of beta and theta.  The left hemisphere demonstrates a breach rhythm with high amplitude slowing.  Epileptiform activity is noted with variability in terms of maximum including T3, T5 and O1.  The epileptiform activity reaches amplitudes of greater than 100 microvolts at times.  The epileptiform waxes and wanes.  It does not have clear frequency evolution as might be seen in a typical seizure but the pattern described above certainly does have evolution, although it never really slows or completely stops.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated low to moderate amplitude 9 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During sleep, symmetrical vertex waves, sleep spindles and K complexes are observed.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  Early in the recording there is a significant EMG artifact due to the patient locking his jaw.  Additionally, an episode of rapid generalized shaking is captured.  This episode lasted approximately 20 to 30 seconds.  Electrographically, it is associated with diffuse pronounced EMG artifact without associated ictal activity prior, during or after the episode.
FINDINGS:
Episode of shaking without  abnormal ictal activity.
No epileptiform discharges.
Stage 2 sleep.

LENGTH OF RECORDING:  25 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is an 84-year-old woman with a history of seizures for approximately 1 year.  Seizures are characterized as a loss of awareness with associated rhythmic left thumb/left hand movements.  These episodes last up to 45 minutes with post-ictal period lasting for approximately 20 minutes.  No associated falls and no generalized tonic/clonic convulsions.
MEDICATIONS:  Trileptal 300 mg b.i.d., Namenda, Aricept, Synthroid, metoprolol, Lipitor, and furosemide.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well formed and modulated moderate amplitude 10 to 10.5 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During sleep the posterior dominant rhythm attenuates and theta activity becomes more prominent.  Intermittent shifting theta and delta activity is observed over the bitemporal regions.  This activity is more pronounced over the right temporal region.  A single sharp wave with after-going slow wave is captured over the right anterior temporal region with a phased reversal of F8/T4 electrodes.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving with multiple flash frequencies.  A single EKG lead demonstrates an irregular heart rate.
FINDINGS:
Shifting mild to moderate bitemporal slowing, right greater than left.  A single sharp wave with after-going slow wave over the right anterior temporal region, with phased reversal of F8/T4 electrode.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal awake and drowsy 25-minute EEG due to shifting mild to moderate intermittent bitemporal slowing and a single right anterior temporal epileptiform discharge.  Some degree of temporal slowing is considered normal in patients over the age of 65, however, this recording demonstrates a high degree of slowing.  There is a potential epileptic focus emanating from the right anterior temporal region.  Focal bitemporal slowing indicates focal cerebral dysfunction, possibly structural in etiology.

Overall, the background consists of delta, low amplitude delta slow waves with intermittent bursts of theta and some focal slowing which are described beyond normal discharges.
Abnormal discharges:
Focal slow waves seen intermittently over the right hemisphere, maximal at C4/T4 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz, amplitude of 20 microvolts.
Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz, amplitude 20 microvolts, occurring continuously with intermixed theta slowing seen infrequently.  Again, there is some reactivity to this EEG.
Heart rate:  90.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to generalized slowing, as well as some right central temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the right centrotemporal region which is consistent with a known tumor.  In addition, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology, but may be due at least in part to medication effect.  No seizures or clear epileptiform discharges were seen.

2184,"LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  22 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is an 86-year-old woman with a right temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage status post a right temporal craniotomy with evacuation of a hematoma on 07/08/2013.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Keppra and Protonix.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed at the bedside.  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  There is right to left interhemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms at high amplitudes over the right hemisphere.  The posterior dominant rhythm over the left hemisphere consists of well-formed and modulated moderate amplitude of 9 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly over the left hemisphere.  Over the right hemisphere the posterior dominant rhythm reaches 8.5 Hz alpha activity, but it is unstable and polymorphic.  There is no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient over the right hemisphere.  The background over the right hemisphere consists primarily of a mixture of polymorphic theta and delta activity.  Slowing is especially pronounced over the right frontotemporal region.  Additionally, rhythmic non-evolving 1 Hz prevalent delta runs observed over the posterior right quadrant.  These runs did not have either temporal or spatial evolution, and unlikely to represent electrographic seizures.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  Periods of quiescence are captured, however, normal sleep relaxation is not observed.
FINDINGS:
Continuous moderate right hemispheric slowing most pronounced over the frontotemporal region.
Rhythmic and non-evolving 1 Hz delta activity observed over the right posterior quadrant unlikely representing an electrographic seizure.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal 22 minute EEG due to continuous focal right hemispheric slowing that is especially pronounced over the right frontotemporal region.  This finding indicates focal cerebral dysfunction likely structural in etiology, and in this patient is consistent with a history of right temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage and a craniectomy.  No clear electrographic seizures are captured.

2185,"CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 24 -year-old with epilepsy, seizure free for the last 7 months.  Tends to have clusters of 5 to 6 seizures with dizziness, loss of consciousness, and tonic clonic activity.  Previous long-term EEG monitoring to evaluate these symptoms.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, albuterol.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  Abundant vertex wave, K-complexes, spindles and POSTS were noted in stage II sleep.  Occasional snore arousals and movement were noted in stage II sleep.
Hyperventilation did not activate the record.  Photic stimulation did elicit a driving response.
Heart rate 55-60 BPM.

2186,"CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 26 -year-old male with epilepsy since age 11.  Seizures began while he was watching television.  Last seizure June 27. Seizures characterized by eye blinking, swallowing, loss of consciousness, convulsive activity and confusion.  The patient is unclear as to how often he has these seizures but notes that flashing lights exacerbate them.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This was an awake through stage II sleep record in a patient who was quite sleepy. Photic stimulation was repeated during the EEG and cognitive testing was completed.  Impedances and technical aspects were acceptable.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The patient is very drowsy with an 11 Hz alpha rhythm, generous low voltage, frontocentral beta.  He quickly transitioned from wakefulness to stage II sleep with generous beta followed by vertex waves, K-complexes, and spindles and POSTS.
Hyperventilation produces an increase in beta.
Photic stimulation elicited driving, superharmonic driving and a photo- paroxysmal response.  __________ can be seen as early as 1 Hz with superharmonic driving at 3 Hz.  Epileptiform activity was noted as early as the 7 Hz stimulation with a high amplitude burst of paroxysmal spike and wave activity with polyspike and wave activity.  Typical frequencies include 3 to 5 Hz and the spike and wave activity is typically under a second in duration.  This can be followed by lower voltage spike and wave activity in the occipital regions.  It seems to be a little bit more rapid on the right than the left when reviewed with an average reference.  This pattern of lower voltage spike and wave activity was seen at 7 Hz but consistently at the  faster frequency bursts.
Most bursts of paroxysmal epileptiform activity were less than 2 seconds.  Using a referential montage, they seemed to be maximum at the bin line but sometimes the polyspike activity is a little bit more prominent on the right.  The patient was given a reading task.  No interruption in reading was noted during the brief bursts, none of which were longer than 3 seconds.
An additional interictal epileptiform activity included a generalized  spike and wave discharge superimposed upon a vertex wave which was a little bit maximum to the left.
Heart rate 66 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
A photo- paroxysmal response with spike and wave activity at 7 Hz and above.
A single generalized discharge noted in stage II sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  On the whole, the features described above are relatively symmetric with polyspike and wave activity.  No impairment of awareness occurred with these events.  This EEG is most compatible with a generalized mechanism for epilepsy.  Plans were initiated to step up the patient's outpatient EEG appointment.

INTRODUCTION:  The recording is performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single lead EKG lead.    Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  EEG was performed in the laboratory.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well formed and modulated moderate amplitude 10.5-11 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.
Hyperventilation is performed with fair effort and produces no significant change in the background.  Step photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.
During sleep POSTS (positive occipital sharp transients in sleep), symmetrical vertex waves, sleep spindles, and K-complexes are captured.
After a period of sleep the patient wakes up and reports feeling dizzy.  While she is reporting that the patient's EEG background remains at baseline and normal.  Heart rate remains at baseline and regular.
FINDINGS:
No epileptiform discharges.

INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some muscle artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness and sleep, stage 1.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation which produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Very frequent sharp waves seen at F7/T3 during wakefulness and sleep.
Focal slow waves seen continuously at F3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 microvolts,  in addition increase faster frequencies over that region consistent with a breach rhythm.
SEIZURES:
A seizure was seen at 10:52 a.m.  lasting for 23.6 seconds which electrographically appeared to evolve in the left hemisphere mainly at F7/T3 starting with a delta frequency discharge that appears to be increase in amplitude and frequency, and slow down to sharp waves with a sudden ending.  Clinically, the patient was lying in the chair and reveal any changes.  When questioned at the end of the seizure she appeared to follow commands.
HEART RATE:  84.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to a single left temporal electrographic seizure, in addition to frequent left temporal sharp waves and continuous left frontal slowing.

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some movement artifact throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal organization or normal frontal central beta.  Overall the posterior dominant rhythm appears to reach 8 Hz and appears to be somewhat reactive to eye opening.  The activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz at an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
There are episodes where the patient has a sudden arousal and there appears to be rhythmic delta slowing lasting for seconds.  Clinically, the patient appears to arouse and look around and no other clinical symptoms seem to correlate with this.  However, the fact that this occurs so rhythmically right after an arousal is suspicious but not likely epileptic. Prolonged recording capturing deeper stages of sleep and with further testing may help in elucidating and clarifying this.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient is restless or drowsy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is somewhat slow with a theta pattern as well as generous beta.  Shifting arrhythmic delta is noted, but there is a bit more delta in the right hemisphere particularly centrotemporal and posterior temporal regions.  Arousals are characterized by an increase in beta.  When awake, the patient seems to be quite confused.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not possible.

MEDICATIONS:  Vimpat, Depakote, Keppra, Ativan, Versed, phenobarbital.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG and seizure and spike detection software.  The patient had 1 episode of left arm shaking at 3:28.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing begins, the patient is relatively awake with a lower voltage, but slow pattern on the left and a glimpse of a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  High amplitude periodic complexes were noted from the left hemisphere with a polyphasic component and some frequency evolution.  At 3:39, around the time that the patient has a clinical event with the arm shaking, there is more muscle and a bit more periodicity but no definitive evolution.  In the initial sections of the record, the epileptiform activity more clearly waxes and wanes.
Versed is given around 4:00 p.m. producing a slowing of the periodic activity.  Phenobarbital was given over the course of the evening, again producing some slowing at least transiently.
Over the evening, after the phenobarbital, the patient is described as more awake and more alert.  She was awake at 3:45 a.m. and at that point, there is an increase in epileptiform activity on the right but without clear clinical correlates.
By the morning of the 26th, although the patient waxes and wanes from wakefulness to sleep, there is more sustained wakefulness with a suggestion of an alpha rhythm on the left.
Heart rate 84 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal electroencephalogram due to:
A pattern of periodic activity with waxing and waning, epileptiform activity, and seizures compatible with a late status epilepticus or ictal pattern.
Highly epileptogenic focus in the right hemisphere with some variability in the central and parietal and posterior temporal occipital regions.
Marked slowing on the right.
An improving pattern on the left but one that remains somewhat slow.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG demonstrates an improvement in a worrisome pattern without ongoing clinical seizures but supports a very highly epileptogenic process.

2236,"Total length of the recording: about 16 hours.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 53-year-old man status post cardiac resuscitation on 08/06/2013, who is now undergoing hypothermia protocol.  His current body temperature is 93.8 degrees.
MEDICATIONS:  Include propofol drip and Ativan and others.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording is performed according to the 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  The recording was reviewed at least once during the recording by the attending physician.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  Early in the recording, diffuse EMG artifact is present that obscures multiple leads and limits the interpretation of the recording during those times.  The degree of EMG artifact decreases as the recording progresses, and stops altogether at approximately 9 p.m.  It is unclear why EMG artifact is disappears since no notation is made on the EEG recording, however, it is possible that the patient might have received a paralytic agent.  The background consists of bursts of polymorphic theta and delta activity that are low in amplitude admixed with a period of background discontinuity.  As the recording progresses, bursts of activity shorten and periods of discontinuity increase and the patient finally reaches the burst to suppression ratio.  As the recording progresses, the burst to suppression ratio interval increases gradually, and bursts become shorter and less well formed.  At approximately 6:25 a.m., rhythmic diffuse activity is noted on the EEG.  Based on the video view, it appears to correspond to possible CPR administration.  It discontinues until about 6:47 a.m.  Once this CPR artifact stops, there is no discernible cerebral activity and there is also no heart rate that is picked on the single EKG lead.  Of note, prior to CPR, a single EKG lead demonstrated a heart rate of approximately 30 beats per minute.
FINDINGS:  Diffuse background slowing that increases gradually as the recording progresses.  No clear discernible cerebral activity after approximately 6:47 a.m.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal 16 hour continuous video EEG monitoring due to worsening of background slowing and burst suppression that finally progressed to complete suppression of all background activity.  Sinus bradycardia is noted on a single EKG lead.  After 6:47 a.m., the EKG lead does not demonstrate any heartbeat.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 68-year-old man status post traumatic brain injury with resultant right temporal confusion, traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage who experienced 2  tonic-clonic convulsions last night.  The patient is currently comatose and intubated.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Ativan, and others.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to standard the 10-20  system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  The recording was performed at the bedside.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is right to left interhemispheric asymmetry.  The background over the left hemisphere consists of a mixture of polymorphic, very well amplitude theta and delta activity admixed with prominent beta activity.  The background over the right hemisphere consists of a mixture of polymorphic variable amplitude delta greater than theta as well as under riding faster activity admixed with moderate amplitude sharp waves with after going slow waves emanating from the right frontocentral region.  Phase reversal occurs over F8/F4/C4 electrodes.  There are several electrographic seizures throughout the recording, lasting on average approximately 1 minute.  These seizures are characterized by increase in frequency of sharp waves with after going slow waves observed over the right frontocentral region.  Seizures are characterized by a gradual increase in frequency of epileptiform discharges to approximately theta delta range and then gradually decreasing in frequency and stopping.  Additionally occasional periods of brief background discontinuity are noted.  It is not clear is these seizures have a clinical correlation; however, however on 1 occasion the EEG technologist notices the patient squints at the onset of seizure.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
FINDINGS:
Moderate diffuse slowing.
Focal right hemispheric slowing most pronounced over the right anterior region.
Frequent right frontocentral epileptiform discharges, with phase reversal over F8/F4/C4 electrodes.
Several focal right frontocentral electrographic seizures lasting on average approximately 1 minute.
Excess beta.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal 21-minute electroencephalogram due to moderate diffuse slowing, focal right hemispheric slowing, that is most pronounced over the right anterior region, frequent right frontocentral epileptiform discharges and several focal right frontocentral electrographic seizures with unclear clinical correlate.  Diffuse slowing indicates etiologically nonspecific diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Focal right hemispheric slowing indicates underlying focal cerebral dysfunction, likely structural etiology and is consistent with the patient's history of traumatic brain injury.  There is an electrographic focus emanating from the right frontocentral region.  These findings were conveyed to the Neurology consultant team at the time of the review.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using the standard international 10/20 system of electrode placement in addition to 1 channel of EKG monitoring.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  This tracing captures wakefulness only.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the posterior dominant rhythm was 6-7 Hz in frequency seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is 5-6 Hz diffuse theta activity seen during wakefulness, which is distributed symmetrically.  There is a small amount of low amplitude frontal central beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  There are intermittent bursts of left mid temporal slowing during wakefulness consisting of 5-6 Hz theta activity lasting for 2-3 seconds.  Heart rate was 70 beats per minutes and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG recording due to:
Diffuse slowing of the background with theta activity seen during wakefulness.
Slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm.
Left temporal slowing seen during wakefulness.  There are no epileptiform activity or electrographic seizures noted during this recording.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The above findings could be due to metabolic, toxic, hypoxic, or infectious encephalopathy.  Alternatively, it could be due to the effect of sedating medications or bilateral cerebral dysfunction or degenerative brain disease.  The left temporal slowing could be suggestive of an underlying structural abnormality in the left hemisphere or left temporal dysfunction.  No epileptiform abnormalities are identified in this record.  No seizures were captured.  This does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy or intermittent seizures.  If clinically indicated, a repeat EEG capturing deeper stages of sleep or continuous bedside EEG monitoring may be helpful.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using the standard international 10-20 system of electrode placement in addition to 1 channel of EKG monitoring.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This tracing captures wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the posterior dominant rhythm is 9.5-10 Hz in frequency seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is presence of low-amplitude frontocentral beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  Stage 1 and stage 2 sleep are characterized by disappearance of alpha rhythm, slowing of the background, and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact, as well as presence of posts vertex sharp transients, K complexes, and sleep spindles.  Hyperventilation was performed and results in diffuse slowing of the background activity intermixed with high amplitude 3 Hz delta activity lasting for 1-2 seconds.  Photic stimulation was performed and resulted in a driving response with no abnormal response.  The patient had 2 episodes of body jerks while awake during the recording without any ictal change on EEG.  Heart rate was 60 beats per minute and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG recording capturing wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.  Intermittent body jerks were captured during the recording without any ictal change on EEG.  No epileptiform abnormalities were identified in this record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Intermittent body jerks without any ictal change on EEG suggestive of these being probably subcortical in origin.  No epileptiform abnormalities were seen in this record.  This does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are a clinical concern, a repeat EEG or a 24-hour ambulatory EEG may be helpful.

2280,"CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 22-year-old male with epilepsy since 2006.  Nocturnal seizures, the most recent one week ago out of sleep with incontinence and postictal confusion.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
This is an awake and asleep record.  This is a technically acceptable record, although T1-T2 impedances were slightly above 5 kohms.  There is a fair amount of muscle artifact in wakefulness.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz, 30 microvolt alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness was characterized by slow rolling eye movements and an  increase in beta with transitions in and out of sleep.  There is also some rhythmic central theta, and in sleep electrode artifact was observed at T4.
Photic stimulation was remarkable for artifact and scant, supra-harmonic driving.
Hyperventilation did not significantly activate the record.
In the transition to drowsiness, there was a single, subtle left temporal transient.
Heart rate 72 bpm.  Rare PVCs.
IMPRESSION:  This is a technically challenging, but normal EEG in wakefulness and brief sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No definitive epileptiform features were noted.  There was a single, subtle, left temporal sharp wave.  In that there is only 1 sharp wave, this must be considered artifact.  A repeat tracing capturing deeper stages of sleep may be of value to more definitively characterize this patient's epileptiform activity.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed. This was a technically satisfactory routine EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta.  Into transition to drowsiness, there is rhythmic temporal theta, rhythmic temporal state of drowsiness, left more so than right.  The patient has some twitching as the patient drifts off to sleep, but these involuntary muscle jerks are not associated with epileptiform activity.  Eye movement and other muscle artifacts were noted including eye movement artifact into drowsiness.
Other features of drowsiness included diffuse background slowing and vertex waves.  The patient was drifting into stage 2 sleep during photic stimulation.  Despite this, a scant driving response was noted.
Hyperventilation produced an increase in amplitude as a background.
Heart rate 72 BPM.

MEDICATIONS:  Concerta and Strattera
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This was a technically satisfactory, routine EEG with acceptable impedances, aside from T1-T2 electrodes.  This was a 20-minute EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10-hertz alpha rhythm noted on the left.  There is an asymmetry noted between the two hemispheres.  The right hemisphere demonstrates continuous right hemispheric flowing with rhythmic delta.  When an alpha rhythm is present on the right, it is a bit slower, approximately 9 hertz.  Hyperventilation was performed early in the record, accentuating the focal slowing.  During hyperventilation, the patient reported that he felt as if his heart was pounding.  Of note, heart rate increased from baseline of 120 bpm to 156 bpm, during hyperventilation.  Hyperventilation was followed by drowsiness with an increase in beta.  Vertex waves and spindles were noted, which were asymmetric.  The EEG remains asymmetric in phase 2 sleep with continuous focal slowing.
Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.  Following Photic stimulation, the patient starts to transition in and out of stage 2 sleep, at which time rare T2 and T4 sharp waves were noted.
Heart rate 96 bpm in sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due:
Continuous focal slowing from the right hemisphere with disruption of faster frequency activity.
Rare right temporal sharp waves noted primarily in sleep.
Baseline tachycardia, increasing during hyperventilation with clinical symptoms of palpitations.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In this individual with a congenital stroke, focal slowing is an anticipated finding.  The sharp waves noted support a potential for seizures.  What is most significant is that the baseline heart rate was rapid and the patient was symptomatic during hyperventilation.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside in ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient is intubated, poorly responsive and experiencing hiccups.  The patient was examined during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal.  The overall pattern is quite slow.  There is an asymmetry between the 2 hemispheres.  From the right hemisphere, the overall pattern is slow delta with a paucity of faster frequency activity.  Occasional right central sharp waves are noted in the context of a breech rhythm.
The activity on the left is a bit more variable.  With tactile stimulation, some 7 Hz theta activity is identified in the posterior scalp regions.  When the patient is not stimulated, the EEG demonstrates a more diffusely slow pattern with a drop out of the theta previously noted on the left.  In addition, as the patient becomes drowsier, there are more bursts of generalized delta and some shifting, frontal delta a bit more so on the left compared to the right. This is a dynamic record from the left at times, with stimulation the patient awakens and there is a slow but present posterior dominant rhythm.  In sleep, bilateral higher amplitude, delta was noted
Heart rate: 96 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Essentially continuous focal slowing from the right hemisphere.

INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed in the EEG monitoring unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Seizure and spike detection software was utilized.  No clinical seizures were noted.  Behaviorally, although the patient was confused, she was increasingly awake and interactive over the course of the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The initial hours of the EEG monitor demonstrate a very slow background on the right with a bilaterally slow pattern and nearly continuous arrhythmic delta activity in the left hemisphere.  As the recording continues, the patient is increasingly awake and when she is awake, the epileptiform activity attenuates.
In wakefulness, there is intermittent arrhythmic delta activity with discrete spikes or sharps or fast activity in the left hemisphere with a relatively generous field of spread, typically maximum at F1 but clearly involving T3, T5 and even C3-F3.  The activity is generally low voltage and discrete.
Over the course of the recording, the sleep pattern more consistently demonstrates the arrhythmic delta activity and the fast activity.  It is somewhat periodic but does not evolve into seizures.
By the morning of the 30th, the patient is more consistently awake, following commands.  Although she remains confused.  The sleep pattern continues to demonstrate the same phenomenon.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG demonstrates a high amplitude pattern with an asymmetry between the 2 hemispheres.  A posterior dominant rhythm of 7 Hz, 70 microvolts is noted on the right, but is not present on the left.  The left hemisphere is a bit more featureless, lacking in faster frequency activity with some sharply contoured delta and sharply contoured delta maximum at T5 sometimes with an underlying T5 sharp wave or spike.  This can be identified in wakefulness.  In later sections of the record, there is some more rhythmic theta picked up in the left occipital region, not clearly reactive to eye opening  with left occipital sharp waves.  In addition, in relaxed wakefulness, right parietal, P4 sharp waves emerge as the patient's alpha rhythm disappears.
At the end of the record, as the patient drifts off to sleep, the right parietal sharp waves become more prominent.  In addition, there are additional spikes noted in sleep, including FP1, as well as some fast activity in the left frontal region.
Photic stimulation did not elicit a driving response.
HEART RATE:  84 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to.
Marked background slowing.
An asymmetry between the 2 hemispheres with more significant disruption of faster frequency activity in the left hemisphere relative to the right.
