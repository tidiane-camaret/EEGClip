Superimposed upon this is some focal slowing in the right hemisphere particularly the temporal region with arrhythmic delta activity and a poorly defined T6/02 sharp waves.

These findings were conveyed to the Neurology consultant team at that time of the review. The patient will be converted to the long term monitoring.","There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient. The background consists of approximately 3 second bursts of variable amplitude polymorphic delta activity. Bursts of activity are generally poorly formed over the right. Inter-burst interval last approximately 4-7 seconds on average, thus making burst suppression ratio approximately 1:1 to 1:3. No normal sleep architecture is captured. Independent bursts of polymorphic sharply contoured fast activity are captured over the left posterior temporal/posterior quadrant. Four electrographic seizures are captured. These seizures all differ electrographically. The seizures occurred at approximately 11:48 a.m., 11:51 a.m., 12:03 p.m., and 12:38, and last approximately 1 minute 39 seconds, 1 minute 23 seconds, 1 minute 15 seconds, and approximately 3 minutes and 16 seconds, respectively. First electrographic seizure starts with moderate amplitude sharply contoured fast activity emanating from the left posterior temporal region. This activity rapidly evolves into approximately 2.5 Hz rhythmic delta that increases in amplitude and decreases in frequency and spreads to the bilateral occipital region. Seizure number 2 starts over the left lateral leads either over the left posterior temporal region or left anterior temple region. Seizure starts with a low amplitude discrete spikes with after-going slow waves that rapidly increase in frequency into the alpha range (approximately 11 Hz activity) and spread throughout the left temporal region and bilateral occipital regions. This activity gradually decreases in frequency and increases in amplitude, and spreads throughout the left hemisphere. By the end of the seizure, the seizure is characterized by approximately 1 Hz 0.3 second bursts of moderate amplitude, rhythmic, alpha activity. Seizure number 3 is similar in appearance and evolution to seizure number 2, however, it starts over the right temporal region. Seizure number 4 appears to start over the right anterior temporal/mid temporal region. It starts with a 5 Hz small amplitude sharp waves with after-going slow waves that rapidly decrease in frequency. As the seizure progresses it appears to stop over the right temporal region and start over the left posterior temporal region.

However, focal left temporal parietal status epilepticus persists. It resolves with administration of anesthetic agent and initiation of phenobarbital. However, periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges are still observed at that time. Diffuse background slowing indicates __________ nonspecific diffuse cerebral dysfunction. Focal left hemispheric slowing indicates focal cerebral dysfunction, likely structural etiology and in this patient is partially related to postictal phenomenon. These findings were conveyed to the Neurology primary team.","There is right-to-left interhemispheric asymmetry with lower waveforms and high amplitudes over the left hemisphere. The background over the right hemisphere has a posterior dominant rhythm of approximately 8-9 Hz activity with weak anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient. There is additional polymorphic theta activity observed over the right hemisphere. The posterior dominant rhythm over the left hemisphere consists of approximately 8 Hz theta activity without clear anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient. The background over the left hemisphere consists of a mixture of polymorphic theta and delta activity. Throughout the recording additional diffuse low amplitude rhythmic slow delta activity is captured. As the recording progresses, frequency of this delta activity becomes more pronounced. Additionally as the recording progresses the patient appears to start having poorly formed electrographic seizures emanating from the left temporal parietal region. These seizures are characterized by rhythmic theta activity most pronounced over the left lateral leads. As the recording progresses seizures appear to spread diffusely and are characterized by diffuse rhythmic delta activity, with associated blink artifact. Clinically the patient appears to have a rhythmic bilateral eye blinking. Ativan was administered but did not result in cessation of status epilepticus. The patient was subsequently loaded with IV Dilantin. This resulted in resolution of generalized status epilepticus; however, he continued to have focal left temporal parietal status epilepticus. The patient was subsequently intubated at 11:52 p.m. using propofol. This resulted in abrupt discontinuation of status epilepticus as well as diffuse burst suppression. That lasted several minutes. As burst suppression decreased discrete moderate amplitude sharp waves were observed over the left temporoparietal region. Their frequency gradually increased to approximately 1 Hz. These discharges constituted PLEDs. These discharges are accompanied by lower amplitude fast activity thus representing PLEDs-plus. Occasionally frequency of these discharges increases but never lasts longer than 10 seconds. This constitutes a brief ictal rhythmic discharges (BIRDS).","The patient is a 46-year-old man with history of recurrent intracranial hemorrhage, episodes of unclear etiology who now presents with new left temporal hemorrhage and multiple seizures.","Current medications Keppra, loaded with Dilantin, phenobarbital, and placed on Versed drip later in the recording.",,,,Left temporal parietal seizures that slowly evolved into generalized status epilepticus.

Hyperventilation was early on in the record producing bursts of shifting slowing. This can be seen in the right or left As the patient became drowsy, there was an increase in background slowing noted. In early drowsiness, there is a slight asymmetry with a bit more focal slowing noted on the left. The patient is relatively drowsy during photic stimulation and the bursts of shifting slowing noted. During photic stimulation, there was a discrete, frontal, 5 Hz spike and wave complex This discharge has bifrontal representation but is maximum on the right.

In relaxed wakefulness. There Is intermittent focal slowing identified from the right mid to anterior temporal region. Although there Is some artifacts noted in the record including the EKG artifact. There discreet spikes in the right anterior temporal at F8, T2. Hyperventilation is performed early in the record and seems to accentuate the slowing noted from the right. This is followed by drowsiness, which again accentuates the focal and low to medium amplitude sharp waves and spikes from the right anterior temporal region. As becomes drowsy, some of the these lower voltage spikes become a little bit more in morphology and more sustained bursts of focal slowing and additional sharp waves are noted as the patient becomes drowsy with the sharp waves starting to develop into bursts or trains which are not sustained. Unfortunately, photic stimulation is performed just as the patient Is starting to transition this sleep pattern and a scant driving response was noted. Immediately after photic stimulation, the patient transitions into stage II sleep with vertex waves and spindles and K complexes. The epileptiform activity was clearly accentuated by stage II sleep.
